# 2. Competitive Landscape & Pricing

## Question
What are the optimum price points and preferred models (CapEx, subscription, transaction-based) by customer type (rural, digital, MFI, commercial)?

---

## Answer

In a nutshell:  
- Commercial / tier‑1 & 2 banks can support higher absolute deal sizes and are increasingly open to SaaS/OPEX, but still want the *option* of CAPEX + AMC for core/mission‑critical platforms.  
- Rural banks, MFIs and digital banks are far more budget‑constrained and strongly prefer low‑entry SaaS or transaction‑based models, often needing multi‑tenant/shared infrastructure and donor/DFI support.

Below I synthesize “optimum” price bands and model preferences by segment using your market/segment research across Africa and the Philippines.

## 1. Time Horizon: What matters for 18‑month exit vs. longer term

**18‑month exit window (to Q1 2027)**  

For valuation, Sybrin should emphasize:  

- **Commercial banks (tier 1/2)**  
  - A mix of **classic license+maintenance and emerging SaaS**, demonstrating you can close $200K–$2M+ deals with strong reference customers in key markets like SA, Kenya, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Uganda.     
  - Visible **shift of new deals to OPEX/SaaS** (where banks prefer it) to grow recurring revenue, while still offering CAPEX for conservative or regulator‑sensitive workloads.    

- **Digital banks & fintechs**  
  - Clear traction with **pure SaaS / usage‑based pricing**; small initial platform fees ($50K–$200K) plus per‑transaction (KYC, payments, fraud) charges.     

- **Rural banks & MFIs (Philippines + Africa)**  
  - A demonstrable **multi‑tenant SaaS model** at low ticket sizes: $20K–$80K per rural/MFI institution per year, often via consortia or grant co‑funding.    

These show a buyer that Sybrin already operates the “right” commercial models by segment and has upside in expanding transaction‑based revenue.

**Longer‑term (post‑exit)**  

The optimization question shifts to:  

- Deepening **transaction‑based models** (e‑checks/EPO, instant payments, digital onboarding verifications) with per‑transaction fees, especially in digital and MFI segments.    
- Scaling **multi‑tenant platforms** for MFIs/rural banks and SACCOs through associations and shared services (Africa) and the rural bank consortium model (Philippines).     
- Using **donor/DFI capital** to subsidize first‑time adoption among cost‑constrained segments (ADB, AfDB, Gates, etc.).

## 2. Segment‑by‑Segment Answer: Optimum price points & model preference

### 2.1 Commercial banks (Tier 1 & Tier 2)

**Who:** Big universal banks and mid‑size banks (e.g., Standard Bank, Absa, Capitec in SA; CBZ, Stanbic in Zimbabwe; BCI, BIM in Mozambique; Tier 1–2 in Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Namibia).       

#### Preferred commercial models

- **Today:**  
  - **Hybrid CAPEX + AMC OR SaaS** for mission‑critical platforms (payments, fraud, KYC).  
  - Strong institutional comfort with perpetual license plus 18–22% annual maintenance, especially for core or on‑premise deployments.    
- **Directional preference:**  
  - **Increasing shift to OPEX/SaaS for new digital/fraud/KYC layers**, mostly because of capital adequacy and cash‑flow considerations. In SA, Southern Africa and Uganda, banks are explicitly moving toward subscription models for new workloads, with hybrid cloud common.     
  - Want **optionality**: offer both models and let them choose per workload (e.g., SaaS for digital onboarding, CAPEX for branch and payments hub).

**Optimal model mix for Sybrin:**

- For **payments processing / branch / Smart Teller upgrades** and **fraud/KYC** in Tier 1 & 2 banks:
  - Offer **two clear options**:
    - **On‑premise license + 18–22% AMC**, with implementation milestones.  
    - **SaaS subscription** priced per transaction, per account, or per user, with 3‑5‑year terms and CPI‑linked escalations.     
  - For **instant payment connectors, e‑checks/EPO, and digital onboarding**, lean to **SaaS / usage‑based**, since those categories globally tend to be priced per transaction or per verification.     

#### Optimum price bands

Synthesis across markets:

- **Payments platforms (EFT/instant rail connectors, e‑checks layer):**  
  - Regional benchmarks show payments platforms at **$200K–$2M** in mid‑markets like Tanzania and Mozambique, and up to **$2M–$8M** in larger tier‑1 deals.    
  - Zimbabwe tier‑1/2 guidance suggests **$200K–$2M+** depending on scope.   
  - For Sybrin’s typical scope (payments + integration + fraud) at a Tier 1–2 bank, realistic “optimum” full‑scope deal sizes are:
    - **Tier 1:** $1M–$5M (SA) and $500K–$3M in smaller markets.    
    - **Tier 2:** $200K–$1.5M.    

- **Fraud & risk / KYC / onboarding suites:**  
  - In SA, compliance‑driven solutions sit at **$300K–$5M** depending on scope and bank size.   
  - Mozambique and Tanzania benchmarks for fraud/KYC + onboarding range **$100K–$1.5M** per institution.    
  - A Malawi Tier‑2 bank can carry **$120K–$180K ARR for fraud** and **$60K–$90K ARR for digital onboarding** on a SaaS basis, sitting firmly within their $385K–$515K software budget.   

- **Philippines commercial / Tier 1‑2 banks:**  
  - Recommended deals for fraud/Tazana and onboarding sit around **$180K–$650K per bank** (mid‑market), $500K–$1M+ for top tier.   

**Summary for commercial banks:**  
- **Model:** Offer both CAPEX+AMC and SaaS; emphasize SaaS for new layers and products.  
- **Price points:**  
  - Tier 1: $500K–$5M per major platform (license + services), with 18–22% AMC or equivalent SaaS ARR.  
  - Tier 2: $200K–$1.5M per platform; fraud/onboarding around $100K–$300K ARR per solution.

### 2.2 Digital banks & fintechs

**Who:** Neobanks, mobile‑first banks, e‑money issuers (e.g., digital banks in SA, Namibia, Tanzania; GCash‑like players; Philippines digital banks).     

#### Preferred commercial models

- **Strong preference for OPEX/SaaS and usage‑based pricing.**  
  - Digital banks regard tech as 40–60% of total cost base and are highly sensitive to fixed fees; they want scalability and pay‑as‑you‑grow.    
  - They favour **API‑first SaaS, per‑transaction or per‑account pricing**, often with minimal upfront license.     
  - Revenue‑share arrangements and deferred payment until launch/revenue are often attractive for early‑stage fintechs.    

**Optimal model for Sybrin:**

- **Pure SaaS / usage‑based model** with a modest platform/implementation fee and most revenue coming from:
  - Per‑KYC or per‑onboarding fee (e.g., $0.30–$0.50/verification range, which undercuts benchmarks like iiDENTIFii’s $0.53).   
  - Per‑transaction fee for fraud checks or instant payments.    

#### Optimum price bands

- **Africa (digital banks / fintechs):**  
  - SA & regional: initial platform fees **$50K–$200K**, with ARR scaling **$50K–$300K** depending on volumes.     
  - Zimbabwe guidance: **$10K–$100K initial** plus transaction fees or revenue‑share.   
  - Namibia research suggests MFIs/digital banks operate on **$50K–$150K annual tech budgets**, pointing to low initial fees and scaling usage.   

- **Philippines digital banks:**  
  - Recommended ranges for full fraud + onboarding stack: **$150K–$400K license**, total deal **$250K–$650K** including implementation and first‑year support.   
  - OpEx share should be 60–70% of value (recurring) vs 30–40% implementation.   

**Summary for digital banks/fintechs:**  
- **Model:** Pure SaaS/usage‑based; optional revenue share or deferred payment.  
- **Price points:** $50K–$250K initial + usage; total ARR typically $50K–$300K+ depending on volume; $0.30–$0.50 per KYC/onboarding as aggressive benchmark.

### 2.3 MFIs, SACCOs, and small community/rural banks in Africa

**Who:** MFIs and SACCOs in Malawi, Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Zimbabwe; small tier‑3 banks with financial inclusion mandates.       

#### Preferred commercial models

- **Almost exclusively OPEX/SaaS.**  
  - Research across Uganda and Kenya shows Tier 3 and MFIs at **~80%+ OPEX preference**, with CAPEX budgets essentially nonexistent.    
  - They need **low entry price, predictable small payments**, and often benefit from **shared services / multi‑tenant platforms** (e.g., SACCO association hubs, MFI consortiums).     
  - Donor/DFI co‑funding (World Bank, AfDB, KfW, ADB) is frequently critical to close deals.     

**Optimal model for Sybrin:**

- **Multi‑tenant SaaS**, where:
  - A central platform is hosted once (e.g., in Kenya, Malawi, or regionally), and multiple MFIs/SACCOs are onboarded with **config, not custom builds**.    
  - Pricing is per institution per year, with additional per‑user or per‑transaction tiers as they grow.
  - Where possible, embed **donor grants** to subsidize onboarding and first‑year fees.    

#### Optimum price bands

- **Individual MFIs (Africa):**  
  - South Africa guidance: **$50K–$300K** deals for MFIs under multi‑tenant SaaS; MFIs need low cost and minimal customisation.   
  - Malawi research suggests MFIs are a distinct “financial inclusion” segment where price must be “tiered vs Tier 1 banks” and heavily optimized for affordability; practical ARR likely **$20K–$100K** depending on size.   

- **SACCOs (Kenya):**  
  - Shared‑services model is recommended; per SACCO fees must be below what an individual SACCO could pay alone.  
  - Kenya segmentation indicates SACCOs require **quarterly or monthly SaaS** with low entry and perhaps **$10K–$50K per year per SACCO**, depending on size, for KYC/fraud/digital onboarding.    

- **Consortium models:**  
  - For example, 10 MFIs sharing a platform might each pay **$30K–$80K per year**, yielding a total $300K–$800K ARR for Sybrin while staying affordable. This matches both African multi‑tenant MFI guidance and the Philippines rural bank consortium template discussed below.     

**Summary for MFIs/SACCOs:**  
- **Model:** Multi‑tenant SaaS, low entry, donor‑co‑funded where possible; monthly/quarterly billing.  
- **Price points:**  
  - Single institution: $20K–$100K ARR.  
  - Consortium: ~$30K–$80K per institution per year, multi‑tenant.

### 2.4 Rural & thrift banks in the Philippines

**Who:** Rural banks, thrift banks, microfinance‑oriented banks targeted in your Philippines strategy.   

#### Preferred commercial models

- **SaaS subscription with minimal project fees.**  
  - The Philippines strategy explicitly calls for **pay‑per‑transaction SaaS** with low upfront cost for rural/thrift banks, in contrast to traditional African projects.  
  - Donor‑funded implementations (e.g., Gates/UN) cover much of the initial project cost, so banks mostly pay ongoing SaaS.   

**Optimal model for Sybrin:**

- For **fraud (Tazana) and digital onboarding bundles**:  
  - **Annual SaaS license per bank** scaled to size, plus per‑transaction where volumes justify it.  
  - Offer both **individual rural bank pricing** and **consortium pricing** (e.g., 10+ rural banks onboarded via an association or donor project).   

#### Optimum price bands

Philippines pricing resource gives explicit bands:   

- **Rural banks (individual):**  
  - “Financial Inclusion Bundle” (fraud + onboarding) at **$30K–$80K total deal size**, comprising:
    - $20K–$50K license/subscription.  
    - $10K–$30K implementation.  
  - This aligns well with small‑bank affordability while justifying Sybrin’s delivery costs.

- **Rural bank consortium (10+ rural banks):**  
  - Multi‑tenant SaaS at around **$45K per bank** total (license + services), with a target net price around **$35K per bank** after discount.  
  - That implies roughly $30K subscription + $15K services per bank at the high end, which is attractive for donors and sustainable for Sybrin at scale.   

- **Digital banks & e‑money issuers in Philippines:**  
  - Digital banks: **$250K–$650K total deal size** for full-stack fraud+onboarding.  
  - E‑money issuers: **$180K–$700K** depending on scope.   

**Summary for Philippine rural/thrift banks:**  
- **Model:** Low‑cost SaaS subscription + small implementation, with strong donor participation; per‑transaction for fraud/onboarding is ideal.  
- **Price points:**  
  - Individual rural: $30K–$80K total (mostly recurring).  
  - 10+ bank consortium: $35K–$45K per bank total (multi‑tenant).

## 3. Cross‑segment synthesis: Where each model “wins”

Pulling it together, the **“optimum” price/model by customer type** for Sybrin’s portfolio:

1. **Commercial banks (Tier 1 & 2)**  
   - **Price range:**  
     - Core/mission‑critical platforms: $500K–$5M (Tier 1), $200K–$1.5M (Tier 2).  
     - Fraud/onboarding modules: $100K–$500K+ per module, often 18–22% AMC or equivalent SaaS ARR.      
   - **Preferred model:**  
     - Offer **both CAPEX+AMC and SaaS**; use **SaaS** for new digital/onboarding/fraud and for markets with strong OPEX preference (Kenya, Uganda, SA, Namibia).     

2. **Digital banks & fintechs**  
   - **Price range:**  
     - Africa: $50K–$200K upfront + $50K–$300K ARR; $0.30–$0.50 per KYC/onboarding event as competitive unit price.     
     - Philippines: $250K–$650K total deal for full stack.   
   - **Preferred model:**  
     - **Pure SaaS / usage‑based**, optional revenue share and deferred payments.

3. **MFIs/SACCOs / African community banks**  
   - **Price range:**  
     - Single MFI/SACCO: $20K–$100K ARR, mostly SaaS.    
     - Shared multi‑tenant platform: ~$30K–$80K per institution per year in a 5–10‑institution consortium.    
   - **Preferred model:**  
     - **Multi‑tenant SaaS only**, monthly/quarterly billing; strong role for **donor/DFI co‑funding**.

4. **Rural & thrift banks (Philippines)**  
   - **Price range:**  
     - Individual rural: $30K–$80K total; majority as recurring SaaS.  
     - Consortium (10+): $35K–$45K per bank, multi‑tenant.   
   - **Preferred model:**  
     - **SaaS subscription with per‑transaction components**, minimal implementation fees, and heavy integration of **grant funding** in early phases.

## 4. Implications for Sybrin’s pricing strategy

Given Sybrin’s strategic pivot and exit timeline, optimizing price points and models by segment suggests:

- **Standardize 3 commercial “templates”:**  
  1. **Enterprise hybrid (commercial banks):** CAPEX or SaaS, $200K–$5M, 3–5‑year terms, 18–22% AMC / ARR.  
  2. **Growth SaaS (digital banks/fintechs):** Low setup ($50K–$200K) + usage ($50K–$300K ARR+; per‑transaction).  
  3. **Inclusion multi‑tenant (MFIs/rural):** $20K–$80K per institution per year; donor‑compatible.

- **Make transaction‑based models explicit** for e‑checks/EPO, instant payments, and onboarding/fraud; target **per‑transaction rates that undercut current benchmarks (~$0.53/verification) while maintaining margin (~$0.30–$0.45 range).**   

- **Use donor/DFI money to “buy down” implementation CAPEX** in rural/MFI/digital inclusion segments, aligning with the NPO/Gates/ADB strategy already in motion in the Philippines and planned for Africa.     

This segmentation‑aligned pricing architecture gives Sybrin a coherent story for near‑term exit (clear SaaS/recurring traction by segment) and a scalable foundation for post‑exit growth.
