# 6. Sales Execution & Outreach

## Question
How can Sybrin build trust as a new entrant in the Philippines and overcome limited on-the-ground presence?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
Sybrin can build trust in the Philippines by (1) “borrowing” credibility from powerful local and global anchors (Gates, BSP, local champions) and (2) behaving like a committed, long‑term local partner despite limited headcount—through tight execution on the first 10+ banks, strong local partnerships, visible governance, and always‑on support. Over 18 months, the priority is to convert the current donor‑funded beachhead into visible proof of reliability; longer term, it is to institutionalize local presence, co‑create with Filipino stakeholders, and embed Sybrin into the country’s financial inclusion agenda.

## 1. Time Horizon: What Matters Now vs. Later

### 18‑Month Exit View (to Q1 2027)

For the exit window, the Philippines story mainly needs to *prove trust is already forming*, not be fully built out:

- **Land and prove 10+ reference banks via the Gates/Tazana work.**  
  The single strongest trust asset Sybrin can show a buyer is “we run mission‑critical fraud controls for X Filipino banks under BSP mandates, funded by Gates, with 99.9%+ uptime and happy users.” That mirrors their African reliability story (99.9%+ uptime on payments)  .
- **Compensate for limited staff with high‑touch, visible reliability.**  
  In the near term, Sybrin will not have 50 people in Manila like it does in Kenya  . Trust must instead come from: zero‑drama implementations, responsive remote support, and at least one credible local partner/representative.
- **Show a credible path, not full scale.**  
  Buyers will care that the model for rural/thrift banks works and is repeatable (Philippines as “playbook” for small institutions globally), more than they care about total Philippine revenue by 2027  .

### Longer‑Term View (Post‑Exit)

Beyond the exit, to become a trusted, embedded player:

- **Build real local roots:** local entity, local leadership, and a small but capable Manila team that banks recognize as “our people,” replicating the “where are the Kenyans?” effect that drove success in East Africa  .
- **Institutionalize partnerships and ecosystem roles:** long‑term MoUs with associations (e.g., rural banks, thrift banks), universities, and regulators’ initiatives (e.g., financial inclusion, instant payments, fraud).
- **Become part of the national critical infrastructure narrative:** the same way Sybrin is seen as untouchable around payments uptime in Africa, it should aim to be seen as a core risk and transaction‑processing partner for rural and thrift banks in the Philippines.

## 2. Detailed Analysis: How to Build Trust With Limited On‑the‑Ground Presence

Below are the key moves, grounded in Sybrin’s existing strengths and the specific Philippine context outlined in your document.

### 2.1. Use “Borrowed Trust” Aggressively

As a new, unknown foreign vendor, Sybrin should lean on institutions that Filipino banks already trust.

1. **Leverage Gates as a trust bridge.**  
   - Gates funded the build of Tazana (±20M ZAR) and is now funding ~6M ZAR of implementations for 10 Philippine banks  . Gates’ due diligence and sponsorship is a powerful credibility signal.  
   - Sybrin should ensure *every* sales meeting and pitch deck in the Philippines visibly anchors the story in this partnership: “Gates chose this stack and Sybrin to implement it as part of its fraud and financial inclusion work.”
   - Public case studies, joint webinars, and co‑authored whitepapers on fraud risk management in instant payments can highlight this relationship.

2. **Anchor to BSP and regulatory mandates.**  
   - The Philippine central bank (BSP) has mandated fraud risk for instant payments, which is precisely why Tazana is being implemented  .  
   - Sybrin should frame itself as “helping banks comply with BSP requirements and global best practice,” not just “selling software.” This positions Sybrin on the side of regulators and public interest, which reduces perceived risk.

3. **Partner with respected local institutions.**  
   - Identify either a well‑known local tech integrator or a respected consultancy who can be the “face” locally—similar to the non‑negotiable partner strategy Sybrin is planning for Ethiopia  .  
   - For rural and thrift banks specifically, engage the **Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP)** and the **Chamber of Thrift Banks (CTB)** as channels and endorsers. Being featured in their events or newsletters is an implicit trust signal.

4. **Use early adopter banks as champions.**  
   - Among the initial 10 donor‑funded banks, deliberately cultivate 2–3 “reference champions” willing to speak publicly about Sybrin’s reliability and support.  
   - These champions should be visible at conferences and on panels, positioning Sybrin as “the partner that got us compliant and reduced fraud losses” rather than a faceless vendor.

### 2.2. Turn the First 10 Banks into Flawless Proof Points

Trust in a new entrant will be built or destroyed by those first 10 implementations.

1. **Treat the 10 Gates‑funded banks as a single flagship program.**  
   - Align internal KPIs around “10 successful, reference‑ready banks in the Philippines” by a specific date.  
   - Ensure implementation discipline is exceptionally tight: clear scope, predictable timelines, and training adapted to local realities (e.g., limited in‑house tech teams in small rural/thrift banks).

2. **Over‑invest in support quality, even remotely.**  
   - Sybrin’s African differentiator is 99.9%+ uptime and strong support on critical payment rails  . Replicate this in the Philippines with:  
     - 24/7 support coverage aligned with Philippine time zones.  
     - Clear SLAs and escalation paths.  
     - A small, named team for the Philippines so customers see continuity, not a ticket machine.

3. **Design for low project overhead, high self‑service.**  
   - The Philippine model is explicitly SaaS, low‑price, and minimal project fees for rural/thrift banks  .  
   - To avoid being seen as a “high‑friction foreign vendor,” Sybrin should refine the onboarding to:  
     - Install and configure with as little on‑site work as possible.  
     - Offer guided self‑implementation templates, checklists, and online learning paths.  
   - This is also aligned with Sybrin’s strategic intent to use the Philippines as a testbed for self‑serve small‑bank models that can later be brought back to African MFIs and SACCOs  .

4. **Measure and communicate impact early.**  
   - For each of the first banks, track concrete fraud‑related KPIs: fraud attempts detected, reduced fraud losses, improved time‑to‑block suspicious transactions, improved compliance audit scores.  
   - Convert these into simple case studies with local data (even anonymized) and share them with the broader market.

### 2.3. Make “Limited Presence” Feel Like “Always There”

Without 50 people in Manila, Sybrin must be more deliberate about how it shows up.

1. **Install at least one high‑credibility local representative quickly.**  
   - Before building a full office, Sybrin can appoint a senior country advisor or part‑time country manager, ideally someone with:  
     - Prior senior role in a bank or fintech in the Philippines.  
     - Existing trust relationships with rural and thrift banks or BSP programs.  
   - This person’s purpose is not to close technical sales but to act as a relationship bridge, attend meetings physically, and reassure banks that there is a responsible local face.

2. **Use a hub‑and‑spoke support model.**  
   - Manila can initially be a “spoke” supported by a regional hub (likely South Africa or another time‑zone‑compatible center).  
   - Internally, treat the Philippines as a priority account cluster, with dedicated support engineers and implementation leads, even if they sit in other countries. This avoids the perception of “random global team with no ownership.”

3. **Show visible, predictable presence through cadence.**  
   - Commit to a public cadence: e.g., quarterly in‑country visits by senior leadership (CEO/CTO/Head of Product) plus regular webinars specifically for Philippine banks.  
   - This mirrors the positive impact of Kenyan, Zambian, and Ghana visits that catalyzed relationships and opportunities  , showing that Sybrin invests face‑time where it wants to build long‑term relationships.

4. **Localize communication and branding.**  
   - Adapt marketing collateral for Philippine regulatory language (BSP circulars), local fraud typologies (e.g., mobile wallet scams, social‑engineering patterns), and examples from Filipino rural/thrift context instead of African case studies only.  
   - This signals that Sybrin has done homework and is not treating the Philippines as a generic “other market.”

### 2.4. Build a Trust‑Centric Ecosystem Position, Not Just a Vendor Image

Philippine banks—especially smaller ones—are sensitive to being “sold to.” Sybrin should present as a partner in national financial inclusion and risk management.

1. **Align tightly with financial inclusion agendas.**  
   - Rural and thrift banks support underbanked and rural populations, mirroring Sybrin’s financial inclusion focus through Gates‑driven Tazana  .  
   - Position Sybrin as a contributor to BSP and donor goals (financial inclusion, safe instant payments, consumer protection), not just a commercial SaaS provider.

2. **Engage donors beyond Gates for Philippine projects.**  
   - The strategy documents mention other donors (Mastercard Foundation, World Bank, Asian Development Bank) as targets for NPO work  .  
   - Use the Philippine proof‑points to apply for further pilot/scale‑up grants specifically focused on the Philippines or Southeast Asia. Being repeatedly selected by reputable donors compounds trust.

3. **Create educational programs, not only sales pitches.**  
   - Offer free or low‑cost training on fraud risk for instant payments, tailored to rural/thrift banks’ constraints (small teams, limited tools).  
   - Co‑host these with associations or BSP programs where possible. Education‑led engagement is a powerful way to build credibility and relational capital.

4. **Pursue early but careful NPO structuring.**  
   - The current constraint is that an NPO must channel funds to the country where benefit is realized  .  
   - Over time, setting up or partnering with a Philippine‑focused non‑profit‑like vehicle (or contracting via a suitable existing NPO) to receive donor funds directly for Philippine projects would:  
     - Make deployments more efficient (versus the current “100K USD limit via UN, multiple tenders” workaround).  
     - Signal long‑term commitment to the Philippine market and its social outcomes.

### 2.5. De‑Risk Vendor Choice for Rural/Thrift Banks

Smaller banks are especially conservative: they fear being stranded by vendors who disappear. Sybrin can lean on its 33‑year history and multi‑country footprint to counter this fear.

1. **Tell the “we’ll still be here in 10 years” story.**  
   - Emphasize Sybrin’s 33‑year history, 240 solutions across ~20 countries, and long‑standing relationships (e.g., 15+‑year branch network solutions, payments solutions with 99.9% uptime)  .  
   - Explicitly contrast this with 5‑person local startups that may be cheaper but whose longevity is uncertain—a pattern Sybrin has seen in African markets  .

2. **Offer risk‑sharing commercial terms for early adopters.**  
   - For selected rural/thrift banks, use pilot pricing, performance‑based step‑ups, or short‑term “proof‑of‑value” agreements to reduce their perceived lock‑in risk.  
   - This fits Sybrin’s SaaS/transaction‑based intent in the Philippines, where low upfront fees and pay‑per‑use models are designed for affordability  .

3. **Guarantee data portability and clear exit paths.**  
   - Being explicit about how banks can export their data or disengage if they choose de‑dramatizes vendor risk and paradoxically increases trust.  
   - Documenting clear exit procedures (including timeframes, formats, and support obligations) shows confidence and ethics.

4. **Show multi‑market robustness.**  
   - Explain how Sybrin has successfully operated in complex regulatory environments across Africa, tailored to different central banks and payment schemes (e.g., PayShap in South Africa, PesaLink in Kenya, SADC‑RTGS and PAPS connectors)  .  
   - This reassures Philippine counterparts that Sybrin can adapt to BSP specifics and future regulatory evolution.

### 2.6. Internally Align Execution With the Exit Narrative

Finally, trust in‑market also has to serve the corporate exit story.

1. **Prioritize Philippine delivery quality over short‑term revenue maximization.**  
   - With a hard 18‑month horizon, there may be temptation to push for fast monetization beyond donor‑funded work. Sybrin should resist any move that endangers successful, reference‑quality implementations.  
   - A clean story of “10+ banks live, strong NPS, and a growing pipeline of rural/thrift banks” will contribute more to exit valuation than squeezing extra fees out of early customers.

2. **Instrument the Philippine story with metrics buyers care about.**  
   - Track and be ready to show: number of banks live, daily transactions monitored, fraud prevented, SaaS ARR from the Philippines, churn (ideally zero), and pipeline coverage for rural/thrift banks.  
   - Position this as the prototype for a global “small‑bank SaaS and donor‑enabled fraud/fx platform,” which buyers can replicate in other emerging regions.

3. **Document repeatable playbooks.**  
   - Capture what works in Philippine implementation, support, and partner management in a formal playbook.  
   - This increases buyer confidence that the approach can scale in Southeast Asia or other under‑served small‑bank markets.

## 3. Summary

Over the next 18 months, Sybrin does not need a large Manila office to build trust in the Philippines; it needs to convert the Gates‑funded Tazana roll‑out into an airtight set of reference banks, “borrow” trust from Gates/BSP/local partners, and behave like a committed, always‑on partner despite limited staff. Longer term, establishing a small but credible local presence, embedding in the country’s financial inclusion and instant‑payments ecosystem, and institutionalizing donor and association partnerships will turn that early trust into durable, strategic positioning in the Philippine market.
