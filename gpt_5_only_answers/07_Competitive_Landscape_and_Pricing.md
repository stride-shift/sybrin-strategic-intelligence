# 2. Competitive Landscape & Pricing

## Question
How can Sybrin overcome its proof of value vs pricing challenge, where competitors undercut on price to buy market share?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
Sybrin should stop fighting price wars and instead reframe “proof of value” around risk, reliability, and strategic scale that small undercutting competitors cannot match. In practice, this means segmenting deals by risk profile, offering structured low-friction proofs of value, and monetising Sybrin’s differentiated strengths (99.9% uptime, multi-country support, regulatory alignment, and pan-African scale) rather than discounting software or projects.

Below I break this into (1) an 18‑month exit view, (2) a longer‑term view, and then (3) a detailed playbook.

---

## 1. 18‑Month Exit View (to Q1 2027)

For the exit timeframe, the goal is *not* to redesign the whole commercial model. The goal is to:  
- Win more of the right deals at sustainable margins.  
- Demonstrate that Sybrin does not have to “buy revenue” through discounting.  
- Show evidence that its pricing power is improving despite low‑price competition.

Within 18 months Sybrin can realistically:

1. **Codify a “proof of value” playbook that is not a free pilot.**  
   - Define 2–3 standard “Fast Value” packages per product (e.g., C2B, digital onboarding, payments, branch network) with a fixed scope, timeline (4–8 weeks), and small but paid fee.  
   - Make these packages explicitly about *business outcomes* that de‑risk Sybrin vs. cheap vendors: e.g., “reduce onboarding abandonment by X%”, “demonstrate compliance with incoming fraud regulation”, “prove processing at Y TPS with 99.9%+ uptime”.

2. **Segment deals and set clear discount rules.**  
   - For tier‑1 and tier‑2 banks, insist on profitable pricing backed by the risk and reliability story; do *not* try to match local 5‑person shops on price.  
   - Use discounting sparingly and only where there is clear strategic upside: group‑wide deals (ABSA‑style), beachheads in new markets (Ethiopia, Ghana), or donor‑funded opportunities (Philippines via Gates).  

3. **Sell “risk and uptime” as a priced feature, not a free add‑on.**  
   - Sybrin’s 99.9% uptime and 33‑year track record are precisely what small undercutters *cannot* match.    
   - Make this explicit in proposals: SLAs, penalties, and multi‑country 24/7 support should be positioned as premium, justifying higher TCO vs. cheaper vendors.

4. **Use upgrades and lifecycle policy to demonstrate pricing power.**  
   - Enforce the software lifecycle policy (must stay within three versions/three years) as planned; this creates proof that Sybrin can successfully reprice without wholesale churn.    
   - The branch network re‑procurement is the flagship case: moving 33 banks from “insane” pricing (10M ZAR across 59 solutions) towards market rates while retaining the majority proves pricing discipline in the face of alternatives.    

5. **Separate “value proof” from “free customization”.**  
   - Preserve the new product‑led discipline: no bespoke “one‑off” builds just to win deals.    
   - If a proof‑of‑value requires configuration, it should be on the standard platform and reusable; if it cannot be reused, it should either be funded (e.g., donor‑backed) or declined.

Evidence of these practices—higher average deal margin, successful repricing of legacy solutions, and structured paid PoVs—will help buyers see that Sybrin is *not dependent* on undercutting to grow.

---

## 2. Longer‑Term View (Post‑Exit)

Post‑exit, with a stronger balance sheet and potentially a more SaaS‑oriented owner, Sybrin can go further:

1. **Full SaaS and consumption pricing for “long tail” banks.**  
   - Extend the Philippines model (low‑friction SaaS, pay‑per‑transaction, minimal project fees) to African MFIs, SACCOs, and tier‑3 banks once products are ready.    
   - This removes the capex sticker shock where cheap local competitors often win purely on upfront price.

2. **Proof of value by cohort benchmarks and data.**  
   - With a wider SaaS base, Sybrin can use anonymized data to prove value: “Banks using our digital onboarding see X% faster account opening” or “institutions on Tazana‑based fraud controls in the Philippines achieved Y% fraud loss reduction.”    
   - Competitors who are just selling software licenses cannot easily match a data‑backed value proposition.

3. **Platform and ecosystem play.**  
   - As the product suite matures (instant payments, e‑checks/EPO, upgraded branch network, C2B) Sybrin can bundle capabilities as a platform with third‑party integrations.    
   - This makes comparisons to single‑product, low‑price competitors less meaningful: they simply do not solve as much of the bank’s problem.

4. **Outcome‑based and risk‑sharing pricing.**  
   - For mature products, Sybrin can partially tie fees to realized outcomes: e.g., share in fraud‑loss reduction, share in incremental transaction volumes, or KPI‑based price escalators.  
   - This turns “proof of value” into a contractual framework and further blunts simple price undercutting.

## 3. Detailed Playbook: Overcoming the PoV vs. Pricing Challenge

### 3.1 Reframe the Competitive Battle: Risk, Reliability, and Scale

Most price undercutting comes from small local vendors with narrow focus. As your own stakeholders observe, you end up in “features and functions standoffs” where the niche player is cheaper and seems “good enough.”    

Instead of fighting feature‑for‑feature, Sybrin should consistently reposition the evaluation on three axes where it is structurally stronger:

1. **Operational and regulatory risk.**  
   - Banks are under increasing regulatory pressure: instant payments fraud controls (e.g., in the Philippines), data protection, and security audits that legacy frameworks cannot pass.    
   - Sybrin should anchor value on:  
     - Proven ability to pass security and compliance reviews across 20+ countries.  
     - The cost and consequences of a payments outage or fraud incident (fines, reputational damage, regulatory sanctions).  

2. **Reliability and performance at scale.**  
   - Sybrin’s payments infrastructure runs millions of transactions monthly with >99.9% uptime; this is not trivial to replicate.    
   - In PoVs, simulations and SLAs should showcase:  
     - Stress‑tested performance at production‑like volumes.  
     - Historical uptime and incident metrics.  
   - The explicit message: “We cost more because we are priced for critical, non‑stop operation; if your board will not accept outage or fraud risk, the *lowest* price is not the right price.”

3. **Multi‑country support and group scalability.**  
   - Sybrin can support pan‑African groups like ABSA across many countries; a 5‑person local vendor cannot.    
   - In every multi‑market bank, frame Sybrin as the only vendor with:  
     - Offices/personnel across East, West, and Southern Africa plus the Philippines.    
     - Experience following banks into new countries and coordinating group roll‑outs.  
   - This makes “saving 20–30%” with a small local competitor look short‑sighted when the bank’s strategy is regional expansion.

**What this changes:**  
The “proof of value” ceases to be “can your screens do what the competitor’s screens do?” and becomes “can you reliably handle my scale, regulatory requirements, and expansion over the next 5–10 years?” That is a very different contest.

### 3.2 Design Paid, Bounded Proofs of Value

Price pressure often comes from free or cheap pilots where the vendor throws in a lot of customization. Sybrin’s shift to product‑led, low‑consulting delivery is structurally at odds with this; you need a *different* notion of PoV.

For each key product line (e.g., C2B, digital onboarding, fraud/Tazana, branch network, instant payments), define:

1. **A “Fast Value” package with strict guardrails.**  
   - Fixed scope (e.g., 1–2 core use cases, 1 country, 1 integration to a sandbox core).  
   - Time‑boxed (e.g., 4–8 weeks).  
   - Based on *configuration* of standard product, not bespoke development.  
   - Delivered mainly remotely with predefined artefacts (templates, training, test scripts).

2. **A clear, quantified success metric.**  
   Examples:  
   - Digital onboarding: show a reduction in manual KYC processing time, reduction in abandonment, or improvement in straight‑through processing for a sample segment.  
   - C2B: show reduction in email/phone‑based corporate requests and cycle time, plus auditability gains.    
   - Fraud (Tazana/Philippines model): prove the system detects and blocks a defined proportion of simulated fraud scenarios mandated by the regulator.    

3. **A small, paid fee and a pre‑agreed conversion path.**  
   - Price the PoV at a level that covers your direct costs and signals seriousness, but is a fraction of full rollout.  
   - Include a contractual clause: if the PoV meets agreed KPIs and the bank proceeds to production, X% of the PoV fee is credited to the first year’s subscription or license.  
   - This avoids free consulting while making the PoV feel “de‑risked” and mutually committed.

4. **A “no customization” rule in PoVs.**  
   - Any requested functionality that is not in the product roadmap is explicitly out of scope for the PoV; it is either deferred or priced as a change order.  
   - This protects your product roadmap and reinforces your pivot away from bespoke services.

**How this counters cheap competitors:**  
Undercutters often depend on low prices plus high willingness to do ad‑hoc custom work. By comparison, Sybrin offers a short, tightly scoped, outcome‑based PoV that shows serious alignment without giving away the farm. The bank can still “try before they commit” but in a structured, paid way.

### 3.3 Segment and Prioritise Where You Compete on Price

Not all deals should be fought the same way. Sybrin already differentiates between tier‑1, tier‑2/3, and very small players.   Build explicit rules:

1. **Tier‑1 banks (enterprise).**  
   - These buyers care about Gartner quadrants, global references, and risk. Sybrin is at a brand disadvantage vs. large OEMs but at a strength vs. small locals.    
   - Strategy:  
     - Compete head‑on with big OEMs on local presence, agility, cost, and ability to tailor to African realities; price at a discount to global OEMs but *premium to local small vendors*.  
     - Use your uptime and regional track record as the core of the PoV and justification for mid‑to‑high pricing.  

2. **Tier‑2/3 banks (mid‑market).**  
   - These are the sweet spot where Sybrin’s reliability plus local presence beats both big OEMs (too expensive) and small shops (too risky).  
   - Strategy:  
     - Keep software pricing competitive (as you already do) and push most of your differentiation into support, SLAs, and roadmap.    
     - Where budget is tight, consider phasing scope or spreading project fees over multiple years rather than cutting price.

3. **Small local banks / MFIs / SACCOs.**  
   - In Africa you currently do not target these because of the commercial mismatch; in the Philippines you do, via a SaaS/transaction model.    
   - Short‑term (pre‑exit):  
     - Do *not* chase these customers with your heavy implementation model; you will lose to locals or destroy margin.  
     - Only pursue them where donor funding (Gates et al.) covers cost and PoV.  
   - Longer‑term:  
     - Build and port the Philippines‑style model back to Africa when the product stack is ready, so you can profitably reach the long tail without price wars.

4. **Pan‑African group deals.**  
   - Group deals (ABSA, Ecobank, Stanbic, Access) should be the *only* place where you consciously “invest margin” in pricing.    
   - Frame lower per‑country pricing as a trade‑off for multi‑country roll‑out commitments and central decision‑making; this makes strategic sense to a buyer and to an acquirer in 2027.

With this segmentation, Sybrin accepts that it will **lose** some low‑margin, high‑risk deals to undercutters—and that this is healthy. The goal is not 100% win rate; it is a higher win rate where the economics and strategic value justify your price.

### 3.4 Take Cost Out of Delivery So You Can Hold Price

A lot of price pressure is felt on professional services, which you’ve correctly made profitable after years of under‑recovery.   Clients feel “sticker shock” compared to both their historical projects and local undercutters.

Without reducing rates, you can reduce *effective* cost per project:

1. **Standardise implementation playbooks.**  
   - For each major product, define standard implementation patterns (by core banking system, by country) so teams reuse artefacts instead of reinventing.  
   - Turn your 240‑solution experience into templates that shorten projects and reduce overruns.    

2. **Use AI and automation in delivery.**  
   - You already recognise AI will eventually cut support and delivery costs.    
   - Near term, focus on:  
     - Automated regression testing during upgrades.  
     - Code generation for repetitive integration tasks.  
     - AI‑assisted configuration and documentation.  
   - This makes your internal cost base lower, so you can hold rates and still improve margins.

3. **Convert some project fees into subscription uplift.**  
   - For SaaS products, offer lower upfront project fees in exchange for a slightly higher per‑transaction or per‑user fee.  
   - This aligns with your strategic shift toward recurring revenue and makes total cost look more comparable to competitors who may cheap out on projects but have higher hidden support costs.

4. **Tighter scoping and change control.**  
   - Maintain discipline so that initial scope matches fixed‑price quotes; change requests are priced separately.  
   - This both protects margin and educates clients that “customization equals cost,” further nudging them toward standard features.

By reducing real delivery cost and risk, Sybrin can maintain project prices closer to where they are today while still improving overall profitability—counteracting the urge to discount in order to close deals.

### 3.5 Exploit Structural Advantages in PoV: Upgrades, Regulation, Donor Funding

Sybrin has three structural levers that undercutters often lack and that can be built into the “proof of value” narrative.

1. **Upgrade program and lifecycle enforcement.**  
   - Use mandatory upgrades as a way to demonstrate continuous value: every upgrade can be linked to new capabilities (e.g., C2B modules, better security, easier integration).    
   - In PoVs and proposals, show that Sybrin is a *living platform* with a clear upgrade path; many small vendors do a “big bang” implementation and then stagnate.

2. **Regulatory alignment as a forcing function.**  
   - In markets like the Philippines, the central bank’s fraud mandates are the key driver; your Gates‑funded Tazana deployment is a live example of solving that need.    
   - In African markets, align PoVs with:  
     - Upcoming instant payments schemes (PayShap, iPSO, PAPS, SADC‑RTGS).    
     - Check decommissioning timelines, packaged with e‑checks/Electronic Payment Orders and branch modernization.    
   - This positions Sybrin as the partner that is ahead of the regulatory curve, not just a software vendor.

3. **Donor funding and NPO strategy as a “value accelerator”.**  
   - Where donor money is available (Gates, Mastercard Foundation, development banks), build PoVs that are partially or fully funded via your NPO/UN mechanisms.    
   - This removes or reduces price as the primary decision factor and allows Sybrin to showcase value in otherwise price‑sensitive segments (rural/thrift banks in the Philippines, possible MFIs in Africa later).

In each of these cases, the proof of value is anchored in *non‑price* drivers that cheap competitors cannot easily access (donors, regulatory relationships, established upgrade programs).

---

### 3.6 Strengthen Sales Narratives and Tools Around “Why We Cost More”

Finally, to sustain higher pricing while proving value, front‑line teams need sharp narratives and artefacts.

1. **Battle cards that explicitly address low‑price competitors.**  
   - For each market, identify common local undercutters and document:  
     - Their likely weaknesses: limited 24/7 support, narrow product scope, unproven at high scale, single‑country focus.  
     - Questions for clients that surface these risks: “What is their longest‑running deployment?”, “How many countries do they support?”, “What SLAs and financial penalties are they willing to sign?”  
   - Train sales to redirect the conversation from “who is cheaper” to “who is safer and more scalable.”

2. **Total cost of ownership (TCO) calculators.**  
   - Create simple TCO models that include:  
     - License/subscription + project fees + support over 5–7 years.  
     - Estimated cost of downtime, regulatory fines, or failed implementations.  
   - Use real data where possible: examples from clients who tried to replace Sybrin or deferred upgrades and faced issues.    

3. **Case studies on reliability and “cheap failed attempts.”**  
   - Document and publish stories (sanitized) where:  
     - A bank chose a low‑cost competitor and then came back to Sybrin after problems.  
     - Sybrin’s systems handled regulatory change or volume spikes that competitors did not.  
   - This narrative should be embedded in pitches: “We are often called in after cheaper options fail; we prefer to start you on the robust path from day one.”

4. **Account‑based “white space” mapping and prioritisation.**  
   - Build the per‑client product matrix you’ve discussed (what they use vs. what they do not, and whether unserved needs are white space or competitor‑owned).    
   - Target PoVs where:  
     - You already have trust (existing product), and  
     - There is no incumbent solution in the new area, avoiding head‑to‑head fights on price.

This equips sales to defend Sybrin’s price by showing the *hidden costs* of cheap alternatives and by focusing on opportunities where Sybrin’s advantages matter most.

---

## Bringing It Together

Over the next 18 months, Sybrin should not aim to eliminate all price‑based competition. Instead, it should:

- **Clarify where it will not compete** (small deals where low price is the only criterion).  
- **Structure paid, outcome‑based proofs of value** that showcase reliability, regulatory readiness, and scalability rather than free bespoke work.  
- **Enforce lifecycle and repricing disciplines** that demonstrate real pricing power and margin improvement.  
- **Use regulatory change, donor funding, and pan‑African scale** as levers that small undercutters cannot replicate.  

Done well, this will allow Sybrin to win the right deals at the right prices, show healthier economics to potential acquirers by Q1 2027, and lay the groundwork for a post‑exit SaaS‑ and data‑driven model where “proof of value” is built into the platform itself rather than bought with discounts.
