# 1. Market Understanding & Decision Makers

## Question
What is the true demand and willingness-to-pay for Sybrin's solutions in the Philippines and African markets — specifically Digital Onboarding, Payments Processing (EFT, e-checks, instant payments), and Fraud & Risk Management offerings?

---

## Answer

## In a nutshell

Demand and willingness-to-pay for Sybrin’s offerings are **highest where regulation and competitive pressure make these solutions “non‑optional”**—notably fraud/risk management and instant payments infrastructure in both the Philippines and key African markets. Digital onboarding is also in **high demand**, but is more price‑sensitive and requires a clearer ROI story. Sybrin can generally win by pricing **50–80% below Tier‑1 vendors** but still at a meaningful premium to local players, with transaction/SaaS models for smaller institutions and traditional license/SLA for Tier‑1/2 banks.

## 1. Time horizon: what matters now vs. post‑exit (Q1 2027)

### 18‑month exit view (to Q1 2027)

For valuation, Sybrin should prioritize segments and products where:

- Demand is **regulatory or mission‑critical**, so banks will pay even under budget pressure:
  - Fraud/risk management tied to AFASA in the Philippines and central‑bank cyber/fraud directives in Africa.    
  - Real‑time payments processing and switch connectivity (InstaPay/PESONet, GhIPSS, mobile money/instant rails).  
- Willingness‑to‑pay is **proven and comparatively high**:
  - Banks routinely pay **hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars** for payment and fraud platforms in both South Africa and the Philippines.  
- Sybrin has a **clear cost advantage vs. Tier‑1** and can still charge materially more than local vendors:
  - Tizana at **$50K–300K vs FICO $500K–5M** for fraud; digital onboarding at **$0.30–1.00 vs $1–3 per verification**; payments at **$100K–800K vs $300K–2M**.    

Near term, the “true demand” that can be monetized before exit is therefore:

- Philippines:
  - AFASA‑driven fraud management (mid‑market and rural).
  - InstaPay/PESONet‑related payment processing/connectors.
  - Digital onboarding for Tier 2/3 and digital banks.
- Africa:
  - Fraud/risk management and digital onboarding in markets with acute fraud and competitive pressure (e.g., Ghana, Uganda, Kenya).     
  - Instant payments and e‑check/EPO where check decommissioning and real‑time rails are converging.

### Longer‑term view (post‑exit, 3–5 years)

Post‑exit, buyers will care about:

- Scaling **transaction‑based SaaS** into:
  - 500+ rural/thrift/MFI institutions in the Philippines.    
  - SACCOs/MFIs/tier‑3 banks in Africa using models proven in the Philippines (low‑touch onboarding + fraud + payments bundles).
- National or scheme‑level E‑check/EPO and instant‑payments hubs in Africa, giving high‑margin transaction revenue.
- Donor‑funded fraud/onboarding deployments (Gates, ADB, others) as a repeatable entry model.

## 2. Philippines: demand & willingness‑to‑pay by solution

### 2.1 Fraud & risk management (Tizana, AFASA context)

**Demand:** Critical, non‑discretionary  
- AFASA requires automated real‑time fraud monitoring across **600+ BSP‑supervised institutions**; 40–50% still run basic rule‑based systems and 15–20% have no formal fraud solution.    
- Cyber‑fraud losses rose **212% in 2023**; account takeover and phishing dominate losses.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- Benchmarks for fraud/risk systems in PH:
  - Typical fraud deals: **$100K–$1M** depending on size and scope.   
  - Global vendors: FICO and ACI at **$300K–$5M+** per year for enterprise deployments.   
- Sybrin value positioning:
  - Tizana at **$50K–$300K per institution**, i.e., **80–90% lower** than FICO.   
  - For Tier 2/3 banks, GTM documents explicitly frame **FICO $500K+ → Sybrin $50K–150K** per year for AFASA compliance.   

**Implications:**

- For Tier 2/3 and larger thrift banks, **willingness‑to‑pay is high** because:
  - Fraud controls are now a regulatory requirement and a board‑level risk.
  - The Sybrin ticket size sits comfortably within Philippine fraud budget ranges and saves vs Tier‑1 while still being material revenue.
- For rural/MFI banks, WTP is lower per institution, but:
  - Consortium pricing and donor/ADB grants can support **$10K–50K/year per bank** in a shared model, which PH research explicitly recommends.    

**Conclusion for PH fraud:** “True demand” is very strong and **inelastic up to Sybrin’s proposed price bands**. Sybrin can credibly capture **PHP 1–3B** fraud‑related market value (300+ institutions x PHP 3–10M/year) if it executes.   

---

### 2.2 Digital onboarding & KYC/AML

**Demand:** Critical but more ROI‑sensitive

- Digital banks have already acquired **8.7M depositors** with instant onboarding; traditional banks lose customers due to week‑long manual onboarding.   
- Philippines is on the FATF grey list; BSP Circular 1022 and broader AML pressure make KYC automation a regulatory and reputational issue.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- Benchmarks:
  - Digital onboarding/KYC projects in SA/PH typically **$200K–$2M** for banks, plus per‑verification fees.    
  - Global KYC vendors (Jumio, Trulioo, Onfido) charge **$0.80–$3.00 per verification** at scale.    
- Sybrin positioning:
  - **$0.30–$1.00 per verification**, i.e., **50–70% cheaper** than Jumio/Trulioo.   
  - For rural banks in consortium SaaS, proposed **PHP 120K–600K per year** ($10K–30K) per bank for a multi‑tenant digital package, including onboarding and payments.   

**Segment‑specific WTP:**

- Tier 1/2 banks (BDO, BPI, Metrobank, China Bank, PNB etc.):
  - Have history of signing **$50K–$500K+** digital onboarding contracts and per‑verification APIs, matching global benchmarks.    
  - They will pay at or near global pricing **if brand and risk are de‑risked**, but Sybrin must counter “Gartner quadrant” bias by offering pilots and African references.
- Rural/thrift/MFIs:
  - Very cost‑sensitive; they cannot afford Temenos/Oracle/Jumio but can afford **$10K–30K annually** where grants or consortium economies of scale exist.    

**Conclusion for PH digital onboarding:** Demand is strong—driven by competition and compliance—but WTP falls off quickly outside top‑tier banks. Sybrin needs **usage‑based and consortium SaaS** (rather than large upfront license) to unlock the long tail.

---

### 2.3 Payments processing (EFT, instant payments, connectors)

**Demand:** High and growing

- InstaPay volumes reached **₱17.5 trillion in 9M 2025 (175.7% volume growth)**; banks must compete in real‑time payments.   
- 450+ rural banks need InstaPay/PESONet connectivity to stay competitive.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- Market benchmarks:
  - Payment processing platforms in SA/PH commonly sell for **$200K–$2M** plus per‑transaction fees.    
  - Tier‑1 providers (FIS, Fiserv, ACI, Huawei) charge **$300K–$2M** per deployment.    
- Sybrin positioning:
  - **$100K–$800K** for payment processing, i.e., **40–60% lower** than Tier‑1 Western vendors.   
  - For rural banks, PH market‑entry material suggests **$50K–$150K per bank** when co‑funded by ADB grants, then **PHP 120K–360K annual SaaS** in consortium models.   

**Conclusion for PH payments:** Banks treat payment rails as **mission‑critical** and show **high WTP** within the benchmark ranges, especially where real‑time capability and reliability are proven. For mid‑market banks, Sybrin’s price band is fully within demonstrated willingness‑to‑pay.

## 3. African markets: demand & willingness‑to‑pay

Africa is more heterogeneous; however, the jobs‑to‑be‑done work for Ghana, Uganda, Kenya and the South Africa pricing intelligence give a clear pattern.

### 3.1 Fraud & risk management

**Demand:** Critical in multiple African markets

- Ghana: cybercrime losses of **GH₵38M** in 18 months; ATM/POS/card fraud up 80%, mobile fraud GH₵10M; strong need for advanced fraud controls.   
- Uganda: **$272M annual** fraud/economic crime losses and a high‑profile central bank heist; BoU mandates cybersecurity compliance (Dec 2024); fraud seen as crisis‑level.   
- Kenya: identity theft and card fraud rising; banks and mobile‑money providers invest heavily in fraud and biometric ID.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- South Africa benchmarks:
  - Fraud/risk platforms **$300K–$3M**; AML solutions **$500K–$5M annually** for large banks.   
- In Ghana/Uganda/Kenya jobs‑to‑be‑done:
  - Fraud solutions are ranked **“CRITICAL / VERY HIGH DEMAND”**, with revenue potential described as **HIGH or VERY HIGH for all banks**, implying budgets aligned with the SA benchmarks.     

Given Sybrin’s positioning as 50–80% cheaper than FICO/ACI for similar functionality in the Philippines, those relative discounts are also credible in Africa. That suggests:

- Tier‑1/2 African banks can realistically pay **$300K–$1M+** for Sybrin/Tazana‑based fraud systems, with strong appetite where regulation or major loss events have occurred.
- Mid‑tier banks and MFIs can support **$50K–$300K** deals or **$5K–$50K/year** SaaS in consortium/donor contexts.

**Conclusion in Africa for fraud:** True demand is high and budgets can support pricing **well within global ranges**; Sybrin’s discount relative to FICO is more about winning share than overcoming WTP constraints.

---

### 3.2 Digital onboarding & KYC/AML

**Demand:** High where mobile money/fintech competition is intense

- Uganda: digital onboarding is labelled **CRITICAL**; mobile money has 34M+ users vs ~2.5M at largest bank, forcing banks to match instant digital flows.   
- Ghana: 68% onboarding abandonment; some corporates take 100 days to onboard; regulators issuing AML penalties.   
- Kenya: strong move to biometric‑based onboarding and ID verification.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- SA benchmarks again show **$200K–$2M** deal sizes for digital onboarding and ID verification, with per‑verification fees similar to the PH and global ranges.   
- Jobs‑to‑be‑done studies classify revenue potential as **HIGH or VERY HIGH** for digital onboarding in Uganda and Ghana, especially when bundled with fraud and mobile loans.    

Budget‑wise:

- Tier‑1/2 banks in Ghana, Kenya, Uganda are prepared to spend **mid‑six to low‑seven figures** on onboarding stacks, provided:
  - There is a clear competitive driver (fintechs, mobile money).
  - The solution bundles compliance and fraud to reduce vendor complexity.

**Conclusion in Africa for onboarding:** Demand is strong; WTP is comparable to SA/PH mid‑market. Sybrin can likely sell within **$200K–$1M** bands plus per‑verification fees, especially when combined with fraud.

---

### 3.3 Payments processing (EFT, instant payments, e‑checks/EPO)

**Demand:** Very high for real‑time and switch connectivity; declining for traditional check processing

- Ghana: all licensed banks must support GhIPSS Instant Pay; volumes reach **GH₵355B (161M transactions)** with 174% growth.   
- Uganda & Kenya: strong demand for real‑time rails, mobile‑money integration and instant EFT; payments are ranked **HIGH DEMAND** in JTBD analyses.    
- Kenyan and regional markets are moving away from checks; JTBD explicitly advises **de‑prioritizing standalone check processing** and focusing on electronic payment processing.   

**Willingness‑to‑pay:**

- SA benchmarks: payment processing platforms cost **$500K–$10M** in larger deployments, with a mix of license + per‑transaction fees.   
- Ghana/Uganda/Kenya banks, while smaller than SA Tier‑1s, still treat payments as **mission‑critical with low price sensitivity**, aligning with the “mission‑critical” category defined in SA research (HIGH WTP, LOW price sensitivity).   

Sybrin’s envisioned E‑check/EPO and instant EFT modules use **transaction‑based pricing**. Given:

- The high transaction volumes in GhIPSS, mobile money and instant schemes.
- The relative immaturity of per‑transaction monetization in Sybrin’s current African base.

There is **latent value**: banks will accept reasonable per‑transaction fees if the alternative is:
- Losing check‑related credit use cases, or  
- Failing to meet regulatory and customer expectations for real‑time payments.

**Conclusion in Africa for payments:** Willingness‑to‑pay for core payment infrastructure is **high and relatively inelastic**; Sybrin should price at a discount to global hubs but not under‑monetize, especially for new instant/E‑check rails.

---

## 4. Synthesizing “true demand” vs “stated interest”

Pulling this together, Sybrin’s “true demand & WTP” picture across Philippines and Africa is:

1. **Fraud & risk management**
   - Demand: **Critical** in PH (AFASA), Ghana, Uganda, Kenya; non‑optional for regulatory and loss‑driven reasons.      
   - WTP: High; banks accept **$100K–$1M+** price points and **$50K–$300K** for mid‑market offerings, particularly given Sybrin’s 80–90% discount vs FICO.
   - Exit‑window focus: Push Tizana‑based AFASA packages in PH and fraud suites in Ghana/Uganda/Kenya; show recurring SaaS revenue.

2. **Digital onboarding & KYC/AML**
   - Demand: High wherever digital banks and mobile money are eroding incumbents; regulatory compliance adds urgency.
   - WTP: High at Tier‑1/2; medium at rural/MFI; price sensitivity is greater than for fraud/payments.
   - Exit‑window focus: Bundle onboarding with fraud in Tier‑1/2, and use low‑cost multi‑tenant SaaS for rural/thrift/MFIs in PH as lighthouse for African SACCO/MFI expansion.

3. **Payments processing (EFT, instant payments, e‑checks/EPO)**
   - Demand: High for instant payments and connectors in both PH and Africa; declining for paper checks, but E‑check/EPO can unlock new use cases.
   - WTP: Very high for mission‑critical rails, as per SA and Ghana benchmarks; banks care more about reliability and compliance than absolute price.    
   - Exit‑window focus: Secure 2–3 visible instant‑payments wins (e.g., GhIPSS connectors, InstaPay overlays) and at least a pilot national or scheme‑level E‑check/EPO, priced transactionally.

---

## 5. Practical implications for Sybrin’s pricing & segment focus

Given the above:

- **Where to be aggressive on price (to win volume quickly)**:
  - Philippines rural/thrift/MFIs: digital onboarding + fraud + InstaPay/PESONet bundles at **$10K–30K/year** per bank via consortium.   
  - African MFIs/SACCOs once the Philippines small‑bank SaaS model is proven.

- **Where to hold price and compete on value**:
  - Tier‑1/2 banks in PH and Africa for payments and fraud: position at **50–70% of Tier‑1 vendor pricing**, but avoid under‑pricing relative to clear mission‑critical benchmarks.
  - National‑level or scheme‑level E‑check/EPO and instant payments hubs: per‑transaction economics should target **meaningful annuity streams**, not low‑margin connectivity.

- **Where demand is weaker or shrinking**:
  - Standalone check processing without digital overlay, both in PH and in more advanced African markets like Kenya, should be actively de‑prioritized in favor of electronic alternatives.    

Overall, both in the Philippines and across Sybrin’s African focus countries, the research indicates that **budget and willingness‑to‑pay are not the primary constraint** for mission‑critical fraud and payments solutions—**trust, proof‑of‑value, and integration risk are**. Sybrin should therefore price confidently within the ranges outlined above, use pilots and references to de‑risk decisions, and reserve deep discounts for volume‑driven rural/MFI SaaS plays rather than for large enterprise banks.
