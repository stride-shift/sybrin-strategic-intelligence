# 4. Partnerships & Ecosystem Fit

## Question
Why has Sybrin's partner/reseller model underperformed in the Philippines, and how should it be adapted?

---

## Answer

## 1. In a nutshell

Sybrin’s partner/reseller model has underperformed in the Philippines mainly because it was designed around African-style SI/reseller dynamics and not around the Philippines’ relationship‑heavy, family‑bank culture and strict local‑ownership rules. The model must shift from “reseller-led” to “Sybrin‑led + SI‑supported”: Sybrin holds the primary bank relationship and compliance posture, while 1–2 deeply embedded Filipino SIs provide implementation, local support, and the 60%‑Filipino‑ownership channel needed for government and BSP‑linked institutions.   

Below I break down why the current approach has struggled and how to adapt it, with an 18‑month exit lens vs. longer‑term view.

## 2. Time horizon: what matters now vs. later

### 18‑month exit view (to Q1 2027)

For the current shareholders, the partner model only matters insofar as it can:

- Convert the Gates‑funded Tazana work into referenceable bank logos and ARR in the Philippines.  
- Demonstrably scale beyond those 10+ banks with a repeatable GTM motion (Sybrin + 1–2 named Filipino SIs, clear revenue split, pipeline).  
- Show that partner‑sourced deals are real and growing (lighthouse thrift/rural banks, possibly one government‑adjacent institution like LandBank/OFBank via a 60%‑Filipino‑owned channel).  

So the adaptation in the next 12–18 months should be pragmatic and narrow:

- Lock in 1 high‑quality SI alliance (not a broad reseller network).  
- Use that alliance to close 3–5 incremental commercial wins (on top of Gates projects).  
- Document this as a repeatable entry pattern for wider ASEAN to support the exit narrative.  

### Longer‑term view (post‑exit / scaling SEA)

Post‑exit, the buyer will care that Sybrin has:

- A scalable hybrid model (direct + partners) that works for relationship‑heavy, family‑owned banking cultures like the Philippines.  
- A network of 2–3 strong SIs with jointly developed pipeline and delivery capability, not just paper MoUs.  
- A clear playbook for extending the same structure into Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, etc. (where similar local‑presence and partnership expectations exist).

The design should be robust and more standardized: clear partner tiers, enablement, KPIs, and conflict rules, but you do not need the full maturity model before exit—only credible proof that the pattern works.

---

## 3. Why the existing partner/reseller model has underperformed

The under‑performance is mostly structural and cultural rather than purely about “wrong partners”. Four root causes stand out when you compare Sybrin’s default approach with the Philippines playbooks and cultural analysis.

### 3.1 Misfit between pure reseller logic and Philippines relationship culture

In many African markets, a classic reseller/SI model—partner owns the account, Sybrin is the vendor—can work because the main job is local presence and implementation capacity, and banks are used to working through those intermediaries. In the Philippines:

- Decision‑making is heavily relationship‑based, hierarchical, and often involves **family boards**, not only the professional C‑suite. Those relationships are expected to be long‑term and personal.  
- The cultural strategy report explicitly flags that **resellers are not recommended** because they break relationship continuity: if the reseller sales rep changes, the bank feels the main relationship has changed, yet Sybrin never really had a direct relationship to begin with.  

So a partner model that tries to push account ownership fully to a reseller or SI is at odds with a market that expects the core technology partner’s own leaders to be visible and personally accountable over years.

**Implication:** A reseller‑led model underperforms because it delegates exactly the thing (deep, senior‑level relationship and credibility) that the market values most and that Sybrin must own to be seen as a long‑term strategic partner.

---

### 3.2 Misalignment with 60% Filipino‑ownership requirements for key segments

Government‑linked institutions like BSP, LandBank, OFBank and some state‑influenced banks require **60%+ Filipino ownership** for technology vendors in practice.  

Sybrin’s legacy thinking is “we’ll sell directly, partner where convenient”. In the Philippines, that becomes:

- Direct‑only: locked out of some of the most strategically relevant accounts (BSP, LandBank, etc.).  
- Reseller‑only (especially if partner is not carefully vetted): little control over compliance positioning and how Sybrin is represented.

The GTM documents instead recommend a **structured SI partnership specifically selected on 60%‑Filipino ownership and banking track record** to fulfill these requirements while Sybrin remains prime on technology.  

**Implication:** Under‑performance has a regulatory/compliance component: the partner model hasn’t been explicitly designed to solve the 60%‑ownership problem in a way that keeps Sybrin in the foreground.

---

### 3.3 Trying to copy the African “partner palette” instead of a focused SI alliance

In African markets you can afford to have a mix of:

- SIs that sometimes act as resellers,  
- Distributors,  
- Direct major‑account sales with light partner involvement.

The Philippines GTM work argues the opposite: you should pick **1–2 strategic SIs**, integrate them deeply into your execution, and avoid a broad “reseller network” because:

- The SI ecosystem is already crowded and relationship‑heavy (PHP 62.8B / $1.2B industry).  
- Banks want to see **cohesive teams**—one Sybrin + one familiar SI who already works with them—not a carousel of partners.  

Evidence of this recommended focus includes:

- Detailed profiles and scoring for specific SI targets like CBTW and Expleo, with emphasis on existing bank relationships and engineering capacity.  
- A proposed revenue‑share model (Sybrin 60–70%, partner 30–40%) and clear split of roles (Sybrin: platform + L3; Partner: implementation, L1/L2).  

**Implication:** Where the current model has been “generic partner/reseller”, the market needs “named strategic SI alliance with clear joint execution”. Without that, partners don’t invest, and banks don’t see enough coherence or commitment.

---

### 3.4 Role confusion: who really leads sales and owns the bank relationship?

The Philippines cultural and GTM reports are explicit:

- Partnership structure should be: **Sybrin as prime vendor**, SI as **implementation subcontractor or strategic ally**, with Sybrin maintaining direct bank relationship.  
- Reseller models where the partner owns the customer relationship are discouraged because they break the continuity banks expect in a strategic partner.  

If Sybrin’s default partner contracts and enablement are closer to classic reseller (partner sells, Sybrin is a back‑end vendor), then:

- The SI may treat Sybrin as just another SKU to push when convenient, not a strategic anchor.  
- Sybrin’s executives may not be consistently in front of Filipino decision‑makers and family boards.  
- When deals stall (which is common in a 12–18 month Philippines sales cycle), there is no strong, consistent Sybrin presence to patiently carry the relationship forward.

**Implication:** Under‑performance is partly because the model doesn’t anchor Sybrin’s direct presence and senior engagement as non‑negotiable, even when partners participate.

---

### 3.5 Incentive and capability gaps on the partner side

From Sybrin’s broader partner guidance (e.g., Mozambique playbook) we know what “healthy” partner performance should look like: partner‑sourced pipeline share, responsiveness, implementation quality, etc., with explicit mitigation (incentives, dual partners, direct‑sales fallback) when these fall short.  

In the Philippines:

- There is heavy emphasis on **finding** partners (CBTW, Expleo, etc.) but less evidence (in the material you’ve given me) that they have been fully enabled with:  
  - Philippines‑localized battlecards and case studies,  
  - Joint account plans per target bank,  
  - Deal registration and performance metrics.  
- Without structured enablement and joint planning, SIs fall back to their comfort zone (Temenos, core banking, or other higher‑margin services) and Sybrin becomes an optional extra.

**Implication:** Even where partners exist on paper, lack of disciplined enablement, joint GTM planning, and incentives means they are not effectively selling Sybrin, which looks like “partner model underperforming”.

---

## 4. How the model should be adapted

The fix is not to abandon partners, but to **re‑architect the model for the Philippines** around three principles:

1. Relationship continuity (Sybrin executives visibly present).  
2. Regulatory fit (60% Filipino ownership solved via SI, not by Sybrin itself).  
3. Focused, high‑quality SIs instead of a reseller sprawl.

### 4.1 Reframe the model as “Sybrin‑led + SI‑supported”, not reseller‑led

Structurally:

- Make it explicit in all partner contracts and internal playbooks that for banks in the Philippines, **Sybrin always owns the strategic account relationship**. The SI is:  
  - Implementation prime or subcontractor, and  
  - L1/L2 support provider,  
  but not the face of the long‑term partnership.  

Operationally, this means:

- Every priority account (e.g., CARD Bank, LandBank, RCBC, chosen rural banks) has a named **Sybrin executive sponsor** plus a local Filipino account manager, even if opportunities came via a partner.  
- Senior Sybrin leadership participates in key meetings with family boards and C‑suite, supported by the SI but not replaced by them.  

This aligns with the cultural need for relationship continuity and preserves Sybrin’s positioning as strategic partner.

---

### 4.2 Build 1–2 deep SI alliances explicitly tied to the 60%‑ownership and government‑segment strategy

Within the 18‑month horizon, Sybrin does not need a large partner network; it needs **proof that one deep alliance works**.

Recommended moves:

- Select 1 primary SI (e.g., CBTW‑equivalent) with:  
  - 60%+ Filipino ownership,  
  - 5–10+ years in banking tech, and  
  - Existing relationships with target banks.  
- Optionally select a second SI to cover:  
  - Different segments (e.g., rural/MFI vs. Tier‑1/2), or  
  - Contingency if the first underperforms.

Design the alliance so that:

- For **government‑linked / 60%‑ownership accounts** (BSP, LandBank, OFBank):  
  - SI is formally the local vendor (satisfying ownership rule),  
  - Sybrin is subcontracted as technology provider,  
  - But Sybrin executives still attend key meetings and are named on joint presentations, so the bank sees them as the real technology partner.  
- For **private banks and digital banks** without strict ownership constraints:  
  - Sybrin is prime vendor; SI provides implementation and L1/L2 support on a revenue‑share basis (30–40% of services).  

This explicitly turns the partnership into a **route‑to‑compliance and route‑to‑relationship**, not just a route‑to‑market.

---

### 4.3 Standardize a Philippines‑specific partner structure and playbook

Use the existing GTM content to finalize a **Philippines partner playbook**, including:

- **Roles and responsibilities** table (already partially defined): who sells what, who leads pre‑sales, who signs which contracts, who handles which support tiers.  
- **Engagement model:**  
  - Joint account planning for top 10 target banks,  
  - Deal registration to avoid conflict and to track partner‑sourced pipeline,  
  - Quarterly business reviews (QBRs) with the SI to track pipeline, POCs, and implementations.  
- **Training & enablement:** localized:  
  - Battlecards against FICO, Jumio, local vendors, etc.   
  - AFASA/AML/BSP‑specific compliance messaging and demos.  
  - Tazana story adapted for the Philippines fraud/AFASA context.  

For the exit story, you want to be able to show a buyer:

- “Here is our Philippines partner playbook and the SI that is already operating under it. Here are the pipeline numbers, POC conversions, and 3–5 reference customers.”

---

### 4.4 Tighten partner incentives and performance management

Adapt the Mozambique performance‑management logic for the Philippines:  

- Define KPIs for the SI:  
  - % of total Philippines pipeline sourced (target >20–30% after year 1),  
  - POC‑to‑deal conversion rate,  
  - Customer satisfaction on partner‑led implementations (≥4/5).  
- Link higher commission tiers or bonus pools to:  
  - Reaching pipeline and revenue thresholds,  
  - Successful delivery on the first 3–5 lighthouse projects.  
- Include contractual performance clauses:  
  - If partner‑sourced pipeline < threshold by month X, trigger a formal improvement plan;  
  - If still underperforming, Sybrin can activate a second SI or move more direct.  

This makes “partner model underperforming” a **managed, reversible situation** instead of a passive outcome.

---

### 4.5 Make partner integration part of the Gates/Tazana and rural bank story

Because you already have Gates‑funded Tazana implementations with 10+ banks in the Philippines, this is the fastest lever to validate the adapted model:

- Involve the chosen SI as implementation and L1/L2 support on Tazana projects; this:  
  - Builds their familiarity with Sybrin’s stack,  
  - Creates immediate revenue for them,  
  - Gives Sybrin joint references that are already in motion.  
- Convert those donor‑funded clients into **commercial upsell opportunities** (e.g., broader fraud, onboarding, or payments modules) using the joint Sybrin + SI team.

For rural and thrift banks (core of Sybrin’s Philippines thesis):

- Use the SI’s local presence and relationships to run **consortium or group offers** across multiple thrift banks, as already recommended in the market‑analysis document.  
- Package this as a “fraud + onboarding + AFASA compliance” bundle with simple SaaS pricing—SI benefits from volume implementation work, Sybrin from recurring ARR.

This will matter for the exit because you can show:

- “Ten donor‑funded Tazana banks + X commercial add‑ons through our Sybrin + [SI] model, with a visible path to 80–100 customers and $30–50M ARR in the Philippines over time.”  

---

### 4.6 Add cultural and governance elements to the partnership approach

Finally, because cultural missteps are expensive in the Philippines:

- Engage a **Filipino cultural/business advisor or advisory board member** (retired bank executive) who sits alongside your SI partner in key relationship‑building and coaches both Sybrin and partner on hierarchy, utang na loob, and family‑board dynamics.   
- Ensure the SI understands Sybrin’s own strategic constraints (18‑month exit, product‑led strategy, no pure consulting): this will avoid them pushing Sybrin into low‑margin bespoke work that undermines your valuation.

---

## 5. Summary: what to actually do in the next 12–18 months

Within the exit window, an adapted and credible partner model for the Philippines should focus on:

1. **Choosing and formalizing 1–2 strategic Filipino SIs** that satisfy 60%‑ownership and have strong bank relationships.  
2. **Locking in the Sybrin‑led relationship structure** in contracts and practice (Sybrin prime in all strategic accounts; SI delivers and supports).  
3. **Embedding the SI into Tazana/Gates implementations** and at least 3–5 commercial deals (thrift/rural or government‑adjacent).  
4. **Measuring and managing partner performance** with clear KPIs, incentives, and QBRs, plus a dual‑partner contingency if needed.  
5. **Packaging this as a repeatable ASEAN expansion pattern** in your exit materials, with clear revenue and ARR numbers and evidence that “Philippines as a lab for smaller institutions + partner‑led delivery” is working.  

That combination addresses why the prior reseller‑style model has struggled, while delivering the concrete, near‑term proof points shareholders and future buyers will care about.
