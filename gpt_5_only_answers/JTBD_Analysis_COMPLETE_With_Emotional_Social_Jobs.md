# Jobs-To-Be-Done Analysis: Top 4 Markets (Data-Grounded)

**Markets**: Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Philippines
**Methodology**: Clayton Christensen JTBD framework applied to documented customer challenges
**Data Source**: 248 research documents with 140+ named financial institutions
**Focus**: Jobs derived from actual customer pain points, then white space identification

**Date**: November 16, 2025

---

## Methodology Difference from Previous Analysis

**Previous approach**: Applied JTBD framework based on expert knowledge and market assumptions.

**This approach**:
1. Start with **actual documented customer challenges** from 140+ named institutions
2. Translate those challenges into JTBD statements
3. Identify **gaps** between what customers are trying to do and available solutions
4. Find white space opportunities

---

## Executive Summary: What the Data Shows

### Customer Intelligence Coverage

- **Kenya**: 40+ named institutions with specific documented challenges
- **Zambia**: 30+ named institutions (heavy MFI/rural focus)
- **Tanzania**: 25+ named institutions (post-core-migration opportunities)
- **Philippines**: 50+ named institutions (most comprehensive data)

### Top Jobs Emerging from Customer Data

**Most urgent jobs** (documented across multiple institutions):
1. **Comply with new real-time fraud mandates** (Philippines AFASA, Kenya check decommissioning)
2. **Scale digital channels without operational meltdown** (Equity Bank 98% target, NMB 6M users)
3. **Serve rural/unbanked profitably** (CARD Bank 329 MBOs, Agora 90% rural clients)
4. **Integrate with instant payment systems** (TIPS Tanzania, iPSO Kenya, InstaPay Philippines)
5. **Digitize agent networks at scale** (Faulu 600+ agents, Zanaco 32k agents, KWFT 231 branches)

### Key Finding: Emotional/Social Jobs Are Invisible in Research

The research documents **functional** challenges extensively but **rarely mentions**:
- How decision-makers want to feel
- Social/reputational concerns
- Fear of obsolescence or competitive displacement

This suggests either:
- Customers don't articulate these needs (but still hire/fire solutions based on them)
- Research didn't probe for emotional/social jobs
- **White space opportunity**: Solutions that address unstated emotional/social jobs

## Part 1: Jobs Derived from Documented Customer Challenges

### Job Category A: Regulatory Compliance Jobs

#### Job 1: Meet BSP AFASA real-time fraud mandate by 2025 without breaking IT budget

- "BAP cybersecurity initiative; AFASA real-time fraud mandate" (44 member banks)
- CARD Bank, PSBank, AllBank, rural banks segment: "Legacy or EOL core banking systems...limited IT budgets...AFASA compliance pressure"

**Job statement**: Achieve full BSP AFASA compliance for real-time fraud detection when IT budgets are constrained and core systems are legacy/EOL.

**Circumstances**:

---

#### Job 8: Process InstaPay/PESONet at scale without building expensive real-time infrastructure

**Documented evidence**:
- Philippines segment: "Intense competition from digital banks and e-wallets (GCash, Maya, etc.), especially around 5-minute digital onboarding and 24/7 services"

## Part 2: Emotional and Social Jobs (Inferred from Context)

The research documents functional jobs extensively but **never directly captures emotional or social jobs**. However, we can infer these from the documented situations and universal human motivations.

### Emotional Jobs for Executives (CEO/MD Level)

#### Emotional Job E1: Sleep at night knowing we won't fail the regulatory exam

**Context inference**:
- Philippines AFASA 2025 deadline with penalties for non-compliance
- Multiple mentions of "regulatory pressure," "BSP examinations," "compliance deadlines"

**Job statement**: Eliminate the 2am anxiety about "what if we fail the BSP exam and I'm personally liable?"

**Why unstated**:
- Executives don't admit fear in research interviews
- "Regulatory compliance" sounds professional; "I'm scared of being fired" doesn't

**Current solutions hired**:
- Hiring expensive consultants (for blame-shifting if it fails)
- Over-spending on compliance (buying peace of mind)
- Delay/avoidance (hope problem goes away)

**Success criteria**:
- Can confidently tell board "we will pass"
- Sleep improves 3 months before exam
- No personal liability exposure
- Have someone to blame if it goes wrong

**White space opportunity**: "Compliance guarantee with executive liability protection" - vendor contractually accepts liability for exam failure, including executive legal defense costs.

---

- Pilot programs (delay actual decision)
- Vendor references (hoping their success = our success)

**Success criteria**:
- Still employed 3 years after go-live
- Technology decision isn't mentioned in exit interview
- Board sees it as prudent, not reckless
- Industry peers ask "how did you choose that?" (not "why did you choose that?")

---

#### Emotional Job E3: Feel like an innovator (not a dinosaur) when board members are 30 years younger than me

**Context inference**:
- Kenya: KCB, Equity Bank described as "digital leadership"

## Part 3: Jobs MISSING from Research (White Space Identification)

The research extensively documents **functional operational challenges** but is silent on several job categories that JTBD theory suggests exist:

### Category A: Strategic Decision Jobs (Not Documented)

#### Undocumented Job: Choose technology investments that won't become obsolete before ROI

**Why it should exist**:
- Multiple institutions mention "core banking on Temenos" or "migration to Flexcube" = multi-year, multi-million $ bets
- Technology cycles are shortening (cloud, AI, open banking)
- Decision-makers have been burned before (mentions of "legacy/EOL systems")

**Why not documented**:
- Research focused on operational pain points, not executive decision anxiety
- Customers don't articulate this as "job to be done" (it's emotional/social)

**Evidence it exists (indirect)**:
- Tanzania: "Azania Bank recently launched new digital platform (Feb 2025), creating opportunity for add-on modules rather than a new core" = fear of core lock-in, preference for modular
- Philippines: "Legacy or EOL core banking systems" = consequence of bad past decisions

**Job statement**: Make technology investment decisions that protect against obsolescence when vendor roadmaps are unreliable and our own 5-year strategy is uncertain.

**Unmet needs**:
- Investment protection clauses (if vendor pivots, we get refund/transition)
- Consumption-based pricing (pay for value delivered, not upfront licenses)
- Modularity that allows mid-stream pivots
- Exit guarantees (data portability, no lock-in)

**White space**: "Hedge" technology procurement models that share obsolescence risk between vendor and customer

---

#### Undocumented Job: Demonstrate innovation to board without betting the bank

**Why it should exist**:
- CRDB, NMB, Equity Bank, KCB are all described as "digital leaders" = competitive positioning
- Board/shareholders demand innovation
- But failed pilots damage reputation

**Why not documented**:
- This is social job (how CEO/CIO wants to be perceived)
- Research asked "what do you need?" not "what do you fear?"

**Job statement**: Show board and market that we're innovative leaders while avoiding failed pilots that damage my credibility and the bank's reputation.

**Unmet needs**:
- Innovation validation frameworks (how to de-risk pilots)
- Pilot-to-production conversion guarantees
- Innovation ROI dashboards that board understands
- "Safe" innovation (proven-elsewhere, not bleeding-edge)

**White space**: Innovation-as-a-service with guaranteed outcomes (if pilot succeeds, vendor scales it; if fails, vendor eats cost)

---

### Category B: Customer Growth Jobs (Partially Documented)

#### Documented but underserved: Acquire profitable customers cost-effectively

**Evidence it's a job**:
- Philippines: "Intense competition from digital banks and e-wallets"
- Kenya: "Cost-to-income ratio improvements via digitalization" (KCB)
- Market saturation implied across all geographies

**But solution gap**:
- Research mentions customer acquisition pressure but NO documented solutions for profitability-based acquisition (only volume-based)

**Job statement**: Acquire new customers who will be profitable within 12 months when customer acquisition costs are rising and best customers are already banked.

**Unmet needs**:
- Pre-acquisition profitability scoring (before we spend to acquire)
- Micro-segmented acquisition funnels (target profitable microsegments)
- Network-effect acquisition (acquire through existing customer networks)

**White space**: Profitability-first customer acquisition platforms (vs. volume-first)

## Part 4: High-Priority White Space (Research Gaps + Underserved Jobs)

### White Space #1: Compliance-as-a-Regulatory-Pass (Not Just Tools)

**Job**: Pass regulatory examinations with zero findings while spending <5% of IT budget.

**Current market**: Compliance tools (KYC, AML, fraud platforms) that help you comply but don't guarantee regulatory pass.

**Gap**: No vendor shares regulatory risk. If you buy FICO fraud platform and still fail BSP examination, that's your problem.

**Opportunity**: "Compliance-as-a-Service" with regulatory pass guarantee:
- Fixed price for regulatory outcome (not tool license)
- If customer fails exam with our platform in place, we cover remediation + penalties
- Revenue model: success fee for clean exams, not upfront licenses

**Addressable customers**:
- Philippines 400+ rural/thrift banks facing AFASA deadline
- Kenya Tier 3 banks (8 named)
- Zambia MFIs/small banks

---

### White Space #2: Instant Payments for Batch-Mode Cores

**Job**: Offer 24/7 instant payments when core banking system only runs batch processing.

**Current market**: Payment gateways that still require core integration, or expensive core upgrades.

**Gap**: No solution for "instant payment facade" that works with truly legacy batch-only cores.

**Opportunity**: External transaction state management:
- Instant payment transactions processed and settled in real-time by facade
- Facade maintains authoritative transaction ledger
- Syncs to batch core overnight
- Core sees it as normal batch file, but customers experience real-time

**Addressable customers**:
- Tanzania community banks (Mucoba, Maendeleo, Uchumi)
- Philippines rural banks with legacy cores
- Any institution with EOL core that can't afford replacement

---

### White Space #3: MFI Micro-Branch Network Management

**Job**: Manage 300+ micro-branches/offices with same oversight as 50 branches.

**Current market**: Branch management for 10-100 locations, or agent banking (but MBOs aren't agents).

**Gap**: Nothing purpose-built for 200-500 micro-sites with <3 staff each.

**Opportunity**: Micro-branch SaaS platform:
- Multi-tenant (affordable for MFIs)
- Offline-first (rural connectivity)
- Simplified compliance (MBO staff aren't bankers)
- Network-level analytics (detect problems across 300 sites)

**Addressable customers**:
- CARD Bank (329 MBOs) = reference customer
- Kenya MFIs with branch + agent hybrid (Faulu, KWFT)
- Any financial inclusion institution with >100 access points

---

### White Space #4: Profitability Transition Management (Not Just Digital Migration)

**Job**: Move customers from 86% digital to 98% digital without losing the 12% who can't transition.

**Current market**: Digital banking platforms (focus on UX), forced migration (fees/closures).

**Gap**: No tools for diagnosing WHY specific customers resist and providing targeted intervention.

**Opportunity**: Customer transition intelligence platform:
- Analyzes transaction patterns to identify resistance reasons (literacy vs. trust vs. access vs. preference)
- Prescribes interventions per customer (training, assisted digital, agent bridge, exception handling)
- Measures transition success and adjusts

**Addressable customers**:
- Equity Bank (targeting 98% from 86%)
- Co-op Bank, Absa Kenya (already 92-94%, want higher)
- Any bank with board pressure for digital % but financial inclusion mandate

---

### White Space #5: Agent Fraud Prevention (Not Just Customer Fraud)

**Job**: Prevent agent fraud without expensive monitoring staff or devices.

**Current market**: Fraud platforms focus on customer-to-bank fraud, not agent-to-customer fraud.

**Gap**: Agent-side fraud is huge risk but underserved (agents stealing from customers, fake deposits, identity theft).

**Opportunity**: Peer agent comparison + behavioral fraud detection:
- Compare agent patterns (if one agent's customers have 10x charge-backs, flag)
- Offline anomaly detection (device-based, syncs when connected)
- Ultra-low-cost (feature-phone compatible, USSD fraud alerts)

**Addressable customers**:
- Zanaco (32k agents)
- Faulu (600+ agents)
- Mobile money operators (Airtel Money, MTN MoMo)

## Part 5: Sybrin Product-Market Fit Analysis (Data-Grounded)

### What Sybrin Currently Offers (Per Research)

1. **Tizana fraud management** - Positioned for Philippines AFASA compliance via BAP consortium
2. **Payment switches and connectors** - Mentioned for instant payment processing
3. **Digital onboarding** - Referenced in Kenya/Philippines context
4. **KYC/AML automation** - Broad capability mentioned

### Jobs Sybrin ALREADY Addresses Well (Evidence-Based)

✅ **Job 1: Meet BSP AFASA real-time fraud mandate**
- Tizana positioned as "BAP-endorsed solution for 44 member banks"
- "$500k-2M consortium deal" pricing fits mid-market
- "Multi-tenant SaaS" matches thrift/rural bank constraints
- **Evidence of traction**: Strategy documents show active Philippines pursuit

✅ **Job 7: Connect to TIPS without replacing core**
- "Payment switches, connectors" = exactly this job
- Mentioned for Kenya (iPSO), Tanzania (TIPS), Philippines (InstaPay)

---

### Jobs Sybrin COULD Address (Minor Extension)

🔶 **Job 9: Digitize 32,000 agents**
- Sybrin has "agent network digitization (identity verification, fraud management)" mentioned for Faulu
- But no evidence of 30k+ agent-scale deployments
- **Gap to close**: Prove can handle Zanaco-scale (32k agents) + feature phone support

🔶 **Job 6: Manage 329 Micro Banking Offices**
- "Branch automation" mentioned but no MBO-specific offering
- CARD Bank (329 MBOs) is named customer = perfect pilot
- **Gap to close**: Build MBO-specific features (offline, simplified compliance, network analytics)

---

### High-Value White Space for Sybrin (Not Currently Offered)

🎯 **White Space #1: Compliance-as-a-Regulatory-Pass**
- Tizana is fraud platform; could add "AFASA compliance guarantee"
- If bank fails BSP exam with Tizana deployed, Sybrin covers remediation
- Revenue model shift: success fee vs. license

🎯 **White Space #2: Instant Payments for Batch-Mode Cores**
- Sybrin has "payment switches" but unclear if they support batch-core facades
- Huge opportunity: Tanzania community banks, Philippines rural banks
- **First-mover advantage**: No one else solves this problem

🎯 **White Space #4: Profitability Transition Management**
- Sybrin has digital onboarding; could add "transition intelligence"
- Equity Bank (86%→98% target) = perfect pilot customer
- **Adjacent to existing product**: Onboarding + analytics = transition management

---

## Part 6: Strategic Recommendations (18-Month Exit Context)

### For 18-Month Exit (Q1 2027)

**Emphasize** (proven, revenue today):
1. Tizana for AFASA compliance (Philippines BAP consortium = $500k-2M deal)
2. Payment switches for TIPS/iPSO/InstaPay integration (Kenya, Tanzania, Philippines)
3. Agent network digitization (Kenya MFIs = proven market)

**Package** (quick bundling of existing):
4. "Tier 2/3 Empowerment Suite" = Tizana + payment switch + digital onboarding
   - Target: Tanzania Tier 2 banks post-core-migration (Azania, DTB, etc.)
   - Positioning: "Add-on modules, not core replacement" (matches their need)

**Pilot** (high-value, differentiated):
5. Compliance guarantee for Tizana (AFASA compliance-as-a-pass)
   - Target: 20 Philippines rural banks via RBAP consortium
   - Proof point for exit narrative: "Only vendor guaranteeing regulatory outcomes"

**Avoid** (wrong timeline):
- New product development (instant payment facade, transition intelligence)
- Markets without existing presence (Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique)
- Long enterprise sales cycles (Tier 1 banks = 12-18 month sales)

---

### For Post-Exit Growth

**Invest**:
1. Instant payment facade for batch cores (White Space #2)
   - First-mover opportunity, huge TAM (every bank with legacy core)

2. MFI micro-branch network platform (White Space #3)
   - CARD Bank 329 MBOs = anchor customer
   - Global MFI market (1000s of institutions with same problem)

3. Compliance-as-a-regulatory-pass business model (White Space #1)
   - Applies beyond fraud (KYC, AML, data protection)
   - Defensible moat (insurance/guarantees)
