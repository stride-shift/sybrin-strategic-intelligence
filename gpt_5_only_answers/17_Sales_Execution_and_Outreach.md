# 6. Sales Execution & Outreach

## Question
How to better understand decision-making timelines and influence networks in key markets?

---

## Answer

In a nutshell:  
To understand decision-making timelines and influence networks in Sybrin’s key markets, you need a structured way to (1) map who actually drives decisions inside banks and donor bodies, (2) overlay that map on each market’s regulatory and budget cycles, and (3) keep it updated through disciplined account planning and targeted intelligence. Over the next 18 months, the priority is to build just-enough structure to improve win rates for current deals and the exit story; longer term, the same structure can be scaled and automated into a repeatable “market operating system.”

Below I’ll lay out a practical approach tailored to Sybrin’s context: what to map, how to collect the data, and how to use it.

---

## 1. Time Horizon: What Matters Now vs. Later

### 18-Month Exit View (to Q1 2027)

Over the next 18 months, the goal is not an academic map of all influence networks, but a pragmatic system that improves deal conversion, speeds up sales cycles, and makes the growth story credible to buyers.

For this period, focus on:

1. **Concentrating on a short list of priority markets and accounts.**  
   Sybrin has already learned not to target 14 countries at once. The current focus is 4–5 countries at a time (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, plus the Philippines)  . For these, you should:
   - Map decision networks inside the top 20–30 banks and key donors/regulators, not everyone.
   - Prioritize pan-African groups (ABSA, Ecobank, Stanbic, Access Bank) and the 33 underpriced branch network customers.

2. **Mapping who moves deals through each stage and what gates they control.**  
   Sales cycles are already known to be 6–18+ months with multiple stakeholders and regulatory reviews  . For exit value, investors will care that:
   - You can show consistent patterns: “In Kenya tier-1 banks, these 4 roles are always involved; here is how we win them.”
   - You can demonstrate shorter or more predictable timelines versus the past.

3. **Aligning intelligence with regulatory events and upgrade milestones.**  
   Sybrin wins when regulation creates urgency (check decommissioning, instant payments mandates, fraud risk rules in the Philippines)  . In the exit window:
   - You need visible evidence that regulatory/funding events are being anticipated and exploited systematically (e.g., “we know who will sign off on PayShap adoption in Bank X and when their budgeting window is”).

4. **Making the system “buyer visible.”**  
   Potential acquirers will look for:
   - A clear pipeline with documented decision-makers and expected close dates.
   - Evidence that relationships are institutionalized (in CRM and processes), not just sitting in individual salespeople’s heads.

### Longer-Term View (Post-Exit)

Post-exit, once capital and sponsorship are clearer, the same foundation should evolve into:

1. **A standardized “influence and timing playbook” per market.**  
   - For each country, a living map of regulators, key banks by segment, donor players, and how decisions typically flow.
   - Codified into training and onboarding so new sales teams can get productive faster.

2. **Data-driven optimization of sales cycle length and win rates.**  
   - Tracking how time-to-close varies by market, segment, and influence pattern.
   - Testing different engagement strategies (e.g., regulator-first vs. bank-first; group HQ vs. local entity first).

3. **Expansion into smaller segments (SACCOs, MFIs, tier 3) and new regions (wider SEA).**  
   - Once Philippines SaaS models are proven and potentially replicated to African small institutions, you will need lighter-weight, more automated mapping of influence (e.g., scoring which associations, aggregators, or processors are “super-nodes” that reach dozens of small institutions at once).

---

## 2. What You Need to Understand: Two Dimensions

To “better understand decision-making timelines and influence networks,” you need to clarify two distinct but connected layers:

1. **Decision-making timelines**: the typical sequence of stages, gates, and delays for key deal types.
2. **Influence networks**: the people and institutions who can accelerate, block, or re-shape those timelines.

### 2.1 Decision-Making Timelines: What to Map

You already know the cycles are long and budget-bound; now you need them codified by *deal type* and *segment*.

For each major deal archetype (e.g., upgrade vs. net-new; instant payments module; corporate-to-bank; digital onboarding; Tazana/fraud; e-check/EPO; donor-funded implementations), you should explicitly map:

- **Typical stages**, for example:  
  1. Problem recognition (often triggered by regulation or security audit).  
  2. Solution exploration / RFI.  
  3. Business case / budget request.  
  4. Technical due diligence & security reviews.  
  5. Procurement & legal.  
  6. Final sign-off and project kickoff.

- **Owner of each stage and gatekeepers** in your core markets:
  - Risk, compliance, or operations for regulatory-driven projects (e.g., fraud/instant payments).
  - CIO / Head of IT architecture for integrations and upgrades.
  - Procurement for price and vendor terms.
  - CFO/COO for final budget sign-off.
  - Board or ExCo where strategic / group-wide decisions (e.g., ABSA Rest of Africa) are made.

- **Average and best/ worst case durations** by market and product.  
  For exit, you do not need perfect data; coarse buckets (e.g., 3–6 months / 6–12 / 12+) based on historical deals are enough to:
  - Build more realistic forecasting.
  - Identify “where things usually stall” (e.g., security review vs. procurement).

- **Budget cycle alignment**:
  - When do top banks in Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, and Ethiopia finalize IT budgets?
  - How far in advance must a business case be on the table to be funded in Year N vs. slip to Year N+1?  
  This is already a known constraint (upgrades often consume whole annual budgets)  ; formalizing it lets you time your proposals better.

### 2.2 Influence Networks: What to Map

Influence networks operate at three levels: intra-bank, cross-bank/group, and ecosystem (regulators, donors, partners).

1. **Inside individual banks**
   - **Formal roles**: CIO, COO, CFO, Head of Retail, Head of Corporate, Chief Risk Officer, Head of Payments, Head of Digital, Head of Compliance/AML, etc.
   - **Informal influencers**: Long-tenure operations managers, “go-to” IT architects, external consultants, or retired executives that banks lean on.
   - **Power structure**: Who can veto vs. who can champion? Who is trusted to assess vendor risk?

2. **Across banking groups and regions**
   - **Group HQ vs. local entity**: For ABSA, Ecobank, Stanbic, Access Bank, etc., you must map:
     - Which decisions are truly centralized (e.g., group standardization on an onboarding or payments platform).
     - Where local CIOs have autonomy vs. where they must follow group standards.
   - **“Super users” and references**: Champions in one entity who influence sister banks across countries.

3. **Regulators, donors, and partners**
   - **Regulators**:  
     - Central bank departments for payments, prudential regulation, consumer protection, and financial inclusion.  
     - Individuals behind key regulations: committees, task forces, working groups.  
   - **Donors & NPO ecosystem**:
     - Program officers at Gates, Linux Foundation, Mastercard Foundation, AFDB, ADB, World Bank, etc.    
     - Implementing partners (e.g., UN units you currently use as intermediaries in the Philippines).  
   - **Technology partners**:
     - Core banking platforms (Temenos, Finastra, IBM core, Thought Machine).  
     - Local implementation partners in markets like Ethiopia where a local partner is mandatory  .  
   These actors often set standards (technical, risk, or financial inclusion) that banks follow, effectively shortening or lengthening your timelines.

## 3. How to Build This Understanding: A Practical Framework

### 3.1 Start with an “Account-Influence Canvas” for Priority Banks

You already maintain a matrix of country → client → products used, which shows white space and anomalies (e.g., a big bank using only e-statements)  . Extend that into a lightweight “Account-Influence Canvas” for your top 30–40 banks and group HQs.

For each priority bank or group, capture:

1. **Organizational decision map for your deal types**
   - List the functions that matter for each type of decision:
     - Payments infrastructure, branch network, corporate-to-bank, fraud/Tazana, instant payments, digital onboarding, etc.
   - For each function, record:
     - Names and roles (CIO, Head of Payments, Head of Retail, etc.).
     - Decision power (approver, influencer, recommender, veto).
     - Past involvement with Sybrin (sponsor vs. blocker).

2. **Relationship strength and channels**
   - Who on your side has the relationship (sales, delivery, support)?
   - How strong is it (weak / moderate / strong)?
   - What’s the preferred channel (in-person, WhatsApp, email, vendor forums)?

3. **Recent and upcoming triggers**
   - Upcoming regulations relevant to that bank (e.g., check decommissioning, instant payments introduction, fraud mandates).
   - Known internal change (new CIO, merger, core banking replacement, digital transformation initiative).
   - Donor programs (e.g., financial inclusion pilots) in which the bank participates.

4. **Timeline patterns**
   - How long did their last three major decisions with you take (upgrade, new solution, or large enhancement)?
   - Where did they get stuck (security review, procurement, budget gate)?

You can implement this in your CRM as custom objects or with a simple, standardized template in the short term. There are well-known frameworks from account-based marketing and “account planning” guides that you can adapt; for example, Miller Heiman’s Strategic Selling methodology emphasizes stakeholder mapping and influence lines rather than just org charts  .

### 3.2 Add a “Market Influence Map” per Country

Parallel to account-level mapping, build a country-level “Market Influence Map” for each of the 4–5 active focus markets plus the Philippines:

1. **Regulatory calendar and actors**
   - Document upcoming and likely regulations for:
     - Instant payments schemes (e.g., iPSO/Pesalink in Kenya, PayShap in SA, PAPS, SADC-RTGS)  .
     - Check decommissioning in Kenya, Zambia, Malawi  .
     - Fraud risk mandates (Philippines already has one for instant payments).
   - Identify:
     - The specific central bank departments and individuals who lead these initiatives.
     - Working groups or industry associations that banks participate in.
   - External sources:
     - Central bank publications and consultation papers (e.g., CBK, BoZ, Malawi RB, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) often provide names of responsible departments and consultation timelines.
     - Payment scheme websites and press releases (e.g., Pesalink, PayShap, SADC-RTGS).

2. **Donor and development-finance presence**
   - For the Philippines and African priority markets, map:
     - Active financial inclusion or digital payments programs by Gates, Mastercard Foundation, AFDB, ADB, World Bank, UNCDF, etc.  
     - Grant calls and project timelines (e.g., open calls and deadlines listed on donor sites).    
   - For each, track:
     - Named program officers or in-country leads.
     - Implementing partners (UN agencies, global NGOs, consulting firms).

3. **Partner networks**
   - Local implementation partners (Ethiopia is a must; others often accelerate entry).
   - Local system integrators with strong ties into your target banks.
   - Industry bodies (bankers’ associations, fintech associations) that convene CXO-level forums; these are “influence multipliers.”

4. **Group-level dynamics**
   - For each pan-African group with presence in the country:
     - Is the local bank a technology taker from group HQ, or more autonomous?
     - Who in the country has strong informal influence back to group HQ?

This gives you a view not just of which single bank to talk to, but which *forums* and *people* shape norms and decisions across multiple banks at once.

### 3.3 Systematize Intelligence Collection

Because you are in an 18‑month sprint, focus on methods that piggyback on activities you already perform:

1. **Upgrade projects as intelligence opportunities**  
   You have 150 upgrades in progress and 90–100 still to go, each requiring deep engagement with client IT, security, and operations teams  . Treat each upgrade as:
   - A structured interview opportunity to validate:
     - Who actually signs off on changes?
     - How many layers of approval are needed?
     - What concerns slowed previous projects?
   - A chance to update your Account-Influence Canvas with fresh names, influence levels, and process nuances.

2. **Post-mortems on wins and losses**
   - For significant wins and losses, host *very short* post-mortems (60–90 minutes) focused on:
     - Actual duration by stage.
     - Undocumented influencers or blockers that emerged.
     - Moments where relationships changed the outcome.
   - Capture this in CRM as structured fields (e.g., “hidden influencer identified,” “regulator involvement,” “group HQ override”).

3. **Deal “war rooms” for large, strategic opportunities**
   - For a small number of major deals (e.g., group-level opportunities, first e-check/EPO national deployment, first instant payments processing deal), run war rooms where:
     - The account team co-creates a visual map of stakeholders and influence.
     - You explicitly assign owners to engage each node (e.g., “Strategy lead to cultivate relationship with Head of Risk via thought leadership, not just sales pitch.”).
   - Review this map monthly and adjust based on real interactions.

4. **Leverage donor and regulator consultations**
   - When donors or regulators launch consultations (e.g., guidelines on instant payments, KYC, fraud controls), they often list working group members and invite comments.
   - Submitting thoughtful responses:
     - Puts Sybrin on their radar as a knowledgeable player.
     - Often gives you names and relationships among banks, regulators, and donor staff.

External references: consult frameworks like stakeholder mapping and power-interest grids from project management and change management literature, which give simple, visual ways to capture influence and interest relationships  .

## 4. How to Use This Understanding to Influence Timelines and Outcomes

Knowing who matters and when only helps if you change how you act. For Sybrin, you can use these maps in at least five specific ways.

### 4.1 Pre-empt Budget and Regulatory Windows

You already know that upgrades can consume entire IT budgets and that regulatory timing is often your biggest ally  . With better timeline and influence maps, you can:

- **Align proposals with budget windows**:
  - If Bank X in Kenya closes IT budgets in September, your E-check/EPO or instant payments proposal needs to be fully socialized with CIO, Risk, and Finance by June–July, not August.
- **Use regulatory deadlines as shared urgency**:
  - For example, if check decommissioning in Malawi is officially scheduled for a certain date, run joint planning sessions months in advance with the central bank and bankers’ association to discuss EPO options and fraud controls.
  - This positions you as a partner in solving the regulatory problem, not just a vendor arriving late with a product.

### 4.2 Target the Real Decision-Makers with Tailored Messaging

Because you sell into complex environments where “features vs. price” battles with 5–6-person competitors are unwinnable  , influence mapping allows you to reposition:

- **For CIOs and IT architects**:
  - Emphasize integration track record (Temenos, Finastra, IBM, Thought Machine), 99.9%+ uptime, and security compliance  .
- **For Risk/Compliance and regulators**:
  - Emphasize fraud controls, instant payments risk management, and your work with Gates and open-source Tazana implementations in Philippines  .
- **For CFO/COO and ExCo**:
  - Emphasize economic story: repricing of underpriced legacy products, transaction-based models (EPO, instant payments, digital onboarding), and how your solutions reduce operational losses and support costs.

With explicit mapping, account teams are less likely to “over-serve” technical champions but neglect CFO/COO and risk stakeholders who ultimately influence budgets.

### 4.3 Exploit Group Dynamics Proactively

You already recognise both the threat and opportunity in pan-African groups like Access Bank, Ecobank, and Stanbic  .

Using influence maps:

- **Play offense at group HQ**:
  - Identify group-level CIOs, Heads of Digital, and operating committee members who decide on group-standard platforms.
  - Use strong case studies from one entity (e.g., ABSA Rest of Africa, or a later Philippines success) to argue for group-wide adoption.
- **Defend existing accounts under acquisition threat**:
  - When a Sybrin client is acquired by a bank that prefers another vendor, map decision-makers early and quantify switching costs and risks.
  - Make it explicit to group HQ what they would lose by replacing a 99.9% uptime solution with a new, unproven one, including integration risk and regulatory exposure.

### 4.4 Coordinate Sales, Delivery, and Donor Engagement

Because your business model crosses pure commercial deals and donor-funded implementations, influence networks are more complex than a typical fintech.

- **For Gates-funded or other donor-funded work**:
  - Map and coordinate:
    - Gates program staff.
    - Local implementing partners (UN or others).
    - Regulators who endorsed or shaped the program.
    - Banks who participate in pilot cohorts.
  - Use this network to:
    - Turn donor-funded pilots into commercial scale (e.g., beyond the initial 10 thrift/rural banks in the Philippines).
    - Transfer learnings and introductions to African markets where the same donors operate.

- **For NPO strategy**:
  - As you explore multiple NPO entities to satisfy “benefit must flow locally” constraints  , capture:
    - Which regulators and ministries must approve NPO activity.
    - Which donors prefer which jurisdictions.
    - Which local NGOs or development partners are “kingmakers” in financial inclusion programs.

### 4.5 Make Relationship Capital Visible to Buyers

When the exit process starts (~Q3 2026), you will be asked to prove more than just revenue and profitability. Buyers will ask:

- “How dependent is this business on a few individuals?”  
- “How robust is the go-to-market machine?”  
- “How repeatable are your wins in new markets?”

Your influence and timeline mapping can be turned into a selling point by:

- Showing **documented, institutionalized relationships**:
  - CRM records with named contacts, influence roles, and engagement history across dozens of banks and multiple regulators.
- Demonstrating **repeatable patterns**:
  - For example: “In East Africa tier 2 banks, Sybrin’s average time from initial conversation to contract is 9 months, down from 15, because we know which roles to involve by month 3 and how to address their concerns.”
- Highlighting **ecosystem credibility**:
  - Evidence of participation in central bank working groups, donor-funded programs, and standards-setting initiatives.

## 5. Concrete Next Steps for Sybrin (Next 6–12 Months)

To keep this practical and aligned with your exit horizon, here is a step-by-step plan.

1. **Define a short list of “must-map” entities (4 weeks)**
   - Countries: Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Philippines.
   - Entities: Top 3–5 banks per country + pan-African group HQs + key regulators + two primary donors (Gates + one more).
   - For each, appoint an internal “relationship owner.”

2. **Roll out a simple Account-Influence Canvas template (4–6 weeks)**
   - Implement as a standardized form in your CRM or as a shared template.
   - Train account teams and delivery leads to fill and maintain it.
   - Make completion of the canvas mandatory for:
     - Any deal above a certain value.
     - Any bank in the strategic list.

3. **Use current upgrades and Philippines work as pilots (6–9 months)**
   - For 10–15 active upgrade projects and the 10-bank Philippines Tazana implementation, explicitly:
     - Map stakeholders.
     - Log timeline data (stage durations, blockers).
     - Note cross-bank influence (e.g., one CIO influencing another).

4. **Build a light “Market Influence Map” per country (3–6 months)**
   - Assign a strategy/market intelligence owner per country.
   - Compile:
     - Regulatory calendars and relevant central bank departments.
     - Known donor programs and implementing partners.
     - Key industry associations and their events.
   - Update quarterly with new regulations and programs.

5. **Integrate into governance (ongoing)**
   - Include a “stakeholder and timing” review in:
     - Monthly pipeline meetings.
     - Deal reviews for major opportunities (instant payments, EPO, branch repricing).
   - Make it explicit which influencers have been engaged and which have not.

6. **Prepare an “Influence & Timing” section for the exit data room (12–18 months)**
   - Summaries by region and segment:
     - Typical decision cycles.
     - Relationship coverage.
     - Regulatory catalysts and pipeline.
   - Selected case studies:
     - A Philippines donor-to-commercial path.
     - An Africa upgrade that led to cross-sell and repricing.
     - A group deal (e.g., ABSA Rest of Africa) that illustrates multi-country influence.
