# 5. Product Modernization & Differentiation

## Question
How large is the re-monetization opportunity with existing 33 clients and 59 teller-related solutions generating only ~R10m revenue?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
The 59 teller / branch‑network solutions across 33 clients generating ~R10m per year are *massively* under‑monetised. Repricing via a new, modular version on the modern platform plausibly supports a **5–10x uplift** on this base over time (i.e., **R50–100m p.a.**), with a realistic 18‑month exit view in the **R25–40m p.a.** range if executed well and assuming some churn. Longer term, branching into adjacent modules and transaction‑based models could push this even higher.

## 1. Framing the Opportunity

### What we know from the context

From the transcripts:

- There are **59 branch network / teller-related solutions** across **33 banks**, generating only **~R10m p.a. in total**.  
- These solutions are **~15+ years old**, on **Version 7**, running on legacy architecture.  
- Clients originally paid a **one‑off capex** 15+ years ago and now pay **~18% maintenance** on that old capex, with **years of 0% price increases**.  
- Leadership explicitly label this as "**insane** underpricing" and believe it **“should be 5–10x current revenue at market rates.”**  
- The plan is to:
  - Build a **new version** of the branch network / teller solution on the latest platform.  
  - Make it **modular (4 modules) and subscription-based** (similar to C2B).  
  - **Decommission** the old version and **force re‑procurement** at current market prices.  

So the question is essentially: “What is the realistic size of the re‑monetisation uplift if we execute this strategy?”

## 2. 18‑Month Exit View (Q1 2027)

In the exit window, you need a view that is both credible and demonstrable to buyers. The opportunity has two components: (a) **captured uplift** already realised in contracts, and (b) **visible, de‑risked pipeline** that can be priced into the multiple.

### 2.1 Baseline and theoretical headroom

- **Current baseline**: R10m p.a. across 33 clients / 59 solutions.  
- **Management’s own view**: Market‑rate pricing should be **5–10x that** for equivalent functionality and footprint.  
  - That implies a theoretical steady‑state revenue range of **R50–100m p.a.** from this segment alone on software/subscription.

This “5–10x” bracket will be your upper bound story for buyers. But for the next 18 months, you must discount for implementation speed, client budgets, and churn risk.

### 2.2 Constraints within the 18‑month window

Several realities will cap how much of that 5–10x you can actually bank pre‑exit:

- **Bank budget cycles are annual and tight.** The transcripts explicitly note that major upgrades can consume an entire annual IT budget; customers cannot upgrade and buy many new things in the same year.  
- **Re‑procurement is non‑trivial.** Even though the new solution de‑risks tech and security, going from a 15‑year‑old cheap AMC to full modern pricing is a psychological shock; some banks will push back or delay.  
- **Churn risk is real.** Management accepts that a fraction of clients may walk away rather than accept a 5–10x increase.  
- **Execution bandwidth is limited.** You are already upgrading 240 solutions, with 150 in progress and 90–100 still to go. The same teams will be required for branch/teller modernisation, so you cannot flip all 59 solutions at once.

### 2.3 Reasonable, exit‑relevant scenario

A disciplined but ambitious scenario for Q1 2027 might look like this (all rough, directional):

1. **Client conversion rate by exit:**  
   - Aim for **60–75%** of the 33 banks to have either:
     - Signed onto the **new modular subscription**, or  
     - Signed binding **upgrade / re‑procurement commitments** effective within 12–24 months.  
   - Accept that **25–40%** may still be negotiating, slow‑rolling, or could churn.

2. **Average revenue uplift per converted client:**  
   - Full “5–10x” will likely be realised over several years (as they add modules, volumes grow, etc.), but you can realistically reach **~2.5–4x uplift** on the initial contract for many converted clients within 18 months.  
   - That takes **realised** revenue from R10m → roughly **R25–40m p.a.** by FY27, assuming:
     - Roughly two‑thirds of clients convert.  
     - Average uplift on those converted contracts is 3–4x vs their old AMC levels.  
     - Some clients remain at old pricing or lapse.

3. **Pipeline and run‑rate story to buyers:**  
   You can credibly show buyers that:  
   - The **new platform and modular pricing are live**, with X banks (ideally 15–20) already migrated.  
   - The remaining Y banks are in **formal upgrade / lifecycle enforcement**, with contract structures that will push them towards higher‑priced subscription in the next 24–36 months.  
   - The pipeline supports a **path to the full R50–100m target** as:
     - More modules (beyond core teller) are adopted.  
     - New branch‑adjacent functions (workflow, imaging, risk, analytics) are layered on.

From an exit‑valuation perspective, if you can:

- Show **current run‑rate** in this line of business at **R25–40m p.a.**, and  
- Demonstrate **clear line of sight** to **R50–80m** within 3–4 years (via already signed contracts, lifecycle policy, and roadmap),

then a buyer can capitalise this at a SaaS multiple and pay a premium for what is currently “hidden” value.

## 3. Longer‑Term View (Post‑Exit, Full Potential)

If we step beyond the immediate exit window and assume continued execution by Sybrin or a future owner, the re‑monetisation opportunity can be larger than a simple 5–10x price reset on the existing base.

### 3.1 Full 5–10x realisation on current 33 clients

- Assuming you eventually convert **~80–90%** of existing branch/teller clients to:  
  - The **new modular subscription**, and  
  - Additional modules (document imaging, workflow, branch digitisation, analytics, customer engagement, etc.).  
- And you reach the **upper portion** of your own stated target (say **7–10x** of the original R10m).

Then the **steady‑state annual revenue** from just the current 33 clients could be:

- **R70–100m p.a.** on software/subscription alone.  

This would be driven by:

- Modern market‑rate pricing instead of 15‑year‑old AMCs.  
- Additional modules per client (not just like‑for‑like teller replacement).  
- Slightly higher attach of premium features (reporting, analytics, fraud hooks, etc.).

### 3.2 Additional growth layers beyond the 33 clients

Several further growth vectors compound this:

1. **Selling the new branch platform into your existing client base that does *not* use teller/branch products yet.**  
   - You already have **240+ solutions across ~20 countries**; many clients use only one or two products.  
   - The new branch/teller suite, once modernised, is a **natural cross‑sell** into banks that already trust you for payments, EFT, or onboarding.  
   - Each new deployment would come in at **full modern pricing**, not the legacy AMC model.

2. **Transaction‑based monetisation where possible.**  
   - Today, legacy branch and payments systems are mostly **not transaction‑based**, even though they process millions of transactions.  
   - Over time, parts of the branch/teller stack (particularly where closely linked to payments) could move to **per‑transaction or volume‑tiered pricing**, significantly increasing revenue as volumes grow.  
   - This mirrors what you are planning for **e‑checks / Electronic Payment Orders** and **instant payments**.

3. **New functionality and “branch as a digital hub”.**  
   - Once rebuilt on the modern platform, the branch solution can evolve into a **multi‑function branch platform**, e.g.:  
     - Digital document capture and verification.  
     - KYC refresh and on‑the‑spot onboarding.  
     - Cross‑sell prompts and analytics.  
     - Integration with fraud/risk systems (e.g., Tazana-style rules).  
   - Each of these can be separate **modules or usage‑based add‑ons**, contributing incremental ARPU.

4. **Pan‑African group deals.**  
   - For pan‑African banks (ABSA, Stanbic, Ecobank, Access Bank, etc.), a modern branch/teller platform is a strong candidate for **group‑wide standardisation**.  
   - One group deal could represent **multiple new countries and dozens of branches**, again priced at modern rates.

Put together, a future owner could reasonably see the **branch/teller business line** as a **R100m+ p.a. recurring revenue asset** at scale, with upside from transaction‑based billing and deeper branch digitisation.

## 4. Why the Uplift is Credible (Not Just Wishful Thinking)

To justify the 5–10x potential, you can highlight several structural factors:

- **Switching cost protects you.** Replacing a 15‑year‑old branch system in a bank is expensive, risky, and slow. Banks know:
  - New vendors require big capex, long projects, migration risk, and uncertain support.  
  - Sybrin already runs their core branch workflows and has a **33‑year track record** with **99.9%+ uptime** in critical payments. This significantly reduces willingness to switch purely on price.

- **Security and lifecycle pressure.**  
  - The legacy version is on **old frameworks** that are being flagged by security scans and cannot be properly patched.  
  - Your **software lifecycle policy** (must stay within 3 versions or 3 years; otherwise pay penalty SLAs or be terminated) gives you **formal leverage** to insist on upgrades and re‑procurement.

- **Significant value vs. manual alternatives.**  
  - The branch solution replaces **spreadsheets, emails, phone calls, and paper** as the coordination layer between the bank and branch network.  
  - At proper pricing, this kind of system is easily justified by labour savings, error reduction, and faster operations, especially in complex branch networks.

- **Market benchmarks in enterprise software.**  
  - In global banking software, **15‑year‑old perpetual licenses with low AMC** are the exception, not the norm; most vendors have by now shifted to **subscription and frequent upgrade cycles**.  
  - Market‑rate subscription pricing for mission‑critical enterprise branch and workflow systems is routinely high‑6 to low‑7 figures per bank per year in USD terms for Tier‑1s, scaling down for mid‑tier banks, which broadly aligns with a 5–10x uplift from a deeply discounted legacy AMC base.  
  - For reference, enterprise core and digital banking platforms from vendors like Temenos, Finastra, and others often price at **1–3% of the IT budget of a mid‑sized bank** annually in subscription/maintenance, which dwarfs what your customers are likely paying today for 15‑year‑old Sybrin licenses. (See, e.g., Temenos and Finastra public pricing commentary:  
    - Temenos annual report: https://www.temenos.com/investors/  
    - Finastra overview: https://www.finastra.com/)

These factors make it **rational** – not just hopeful – to view **5–10x** as a realistic long‑term ceiling on this product line’s monetisation for the current base.

## 5. Synthesis: Quantifying the Opportunity

Bringing it all together:

- **Today:**  
  - 59 teller/branch solutions, 33 clients, **~R10m p.a.** revenue.  
  - Severely under‑monetised due to 15‑year‑old pricing and low AMCs.

- **18‑month exit horizon (Q1 2027):**  
  - **Realistic captured uplift:**  
    - Convert ~60–75% of clients to new modular subscription or binding upgrade commitments.  
    - Achieve **~2.5–4x** average revenue uplift on those converted within the window.  
    - Outcome: branch/teller line at **~R25–40m p.a.** run‑rate by FY27.  
  - **Exit story:**  
    - Clear path, via lifecycle policy and already‑signed deals, to **R50–80m+ p.a.** within 3–4 years.  
    - This becomes a key part of the “hidden SaaS upside” narrative for buyers.

- **Longer‑term steady state (post‑exit):**  
  - Full 5–10x realisation on the current 33 clients → **R50–100m p.a.**.  
  - Additional upside from:
    - Selling the modern branch suite into existing Sybrin clients who do not yet use it.  
    - Additional modules (workflow, analytics, fraud hooks, branch digitisation).  
    - Transaction‑based or volume‑tiered pricing on some components.  
    - Pan‑African group deals.  
  - Plausible outcome: **R100m+ p.a.** recurring revenue line over time.

**Answering the original question directly:**  
The re‑monetisation opportunity on the existing 33 clients and 59 teller‑related solutions is **material and strategic**. In pure numbers, you are looking at a **theoretical 5–10x uplift** from **R10m to R50–100m p.a.** on the legacy base alone over the medium term, with a **realistic 18‑month target** of reaching **R25–40m p.a.** in realised run‑rate and a demonstrable pipeline to the higher end of the range for an acquirer.
