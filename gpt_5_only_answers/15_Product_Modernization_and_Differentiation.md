# 5. Product Modernization & Differentiation

## Question
Which emerging global teller trends (self-service, mobile tellers, universal banker/advisory roles) are most important for Sybrin to align with?

---

## Answer

### In a nutshell

The teller trends that matter most for Sybrin are those that:  
1) protect and grow its **branch network / payments franchise** over the next 18 months, and  
2) position it as a **platform for advisory‑led, low‑cost human+digital service** in emerging markets post‑exit.  

That means: **self‑service and assisted self‑service** are the immediate priority (because they drive branch cost take‑out and digital migration now), with **universal banker/advisory models** the key medium‑term alignment, and **mobile tellers** important in selected inclusion markets (Philippines, rural Africa) but not the primary global anchor for the exit story.

---

## 1. Time horizon: what matters when?

### 1.1. 18‑month exit view (to ~Q1 2027)

Given Sybrin’s constraints and goals, the teller trends that matter most in the next 18 months are those that:

- Create **near‑term, monetisable product features** on top of existing branch/payments assets (check truncation, branch network solutions, C2B, digital onboarding).  
- Are **already visible priorities for Sybrin’s clients** (regulation, cost take‑out, branch transformation) so they can move deals within typical 6–18 month cycles.    
- Are **credible to buyers** as scalable growth vectors without requiring Sybrin to become a fundamentally different company before exit.

In this window, Sybrin should align hardest with:

1. **Self‑service & assisted self‑service in and around the branch**  
   - Migrating routine teller work (cash deposits/withdrawals, bill payments, cheque/e‑payment order deposits, statement printing, basic account maintenance) to **ATMs/ITMs, kiosks, digital channels, and assisted self‑service stations**.  
   - Extending its **new branch network platform** and **C2B** into a “branch interaction hub” that orchestrates these flows and captures all interactions across channels.

2. **Advisor‑style “universal banker” workflows, but in light‑weight, overlay form**  
   - Embedding **queue orchestration, lead assignment, and case/workflow tools** into the new branch solution and C2B, so staff can move fluidly between teller, sales, and service roles on the same platform.  
   - Not trying to build full CRM or a full universal‑teller platform, but adding **“advisory mode” capabilities** that make Sybrin’s branch stack the natural place where these models run.

Mobile tellers (staff with tablets visiting customers; agent‑like outreach) are strategically relevant, but they should be treated as a **feature set/usage pattern of digital onboarding + branch/merchant modules**, not as a separate strategic pillar in the exit window.

### 1.2. Longer‑term view (post‑exit, sustained growth)

Post‑exit, the buyer will care about where Sybrin can grow beyond the 18‑month horizon:

- **Universal banker/advisory roles** will become more central as banks globally reduce routine teller headcount and re‑purpose branches to sales, advice, SME support, and complex service. A future Sybrin can lean into this with deeper analytics, sales‑next‑best‑action, and integrated CRM partnerships.  
- **Mobile/field‑based staff and agent networks** will matter more in emerging markets as regulators push inclusion and banks shrink physical branch networks; Sybrin’s Philippines model and potential MFI/SACCO offerings in Africa are natural places to extend this.    
- **Self‑service** will continue to evolve toward broader “universal self‑service” (branch kiosks, smart ATMs/ITMs, video‑teller pods) where Sybrin can power document capture, identity/fraud checks, and back‑office workflows.

Buyers will look for a clear story that today’s branch/payments base can evolve into a **human+digital advisory and transaction hub** across Africa and selected Asian markets.

## 2. Global teller trends – and how they intersect with Sybrin

Below is how the three big teller trends typically play out globally, then how they intersect with Sybrin’s assets and constraints.

### 2.1. Self‑service and assisted self‑service

**Global trend**

- Banks are **aggressively shifting simple, high‑volume transactions** out of teller lines into digital and self‑service devices to cut branch costs and support smaller, more specialised branches.  
- McKinsey and others note that leading banks have **removed 30–60% of teller transactions** through digital and self‑service migration, while shrinking or re‑configuring branch footprints.  
- Modern “self‑service” is not just ATMs; it includes:  
  - Smart ATMs / ITMs (video teller, remote teller assistance)  
  - Branch kiosks for account opening, cheque/e‑payment order deposit, statement requests and service ticketing  
  - Assisted self‑service stations where staff **help customers use devices** (often first step away from traditional teller windows).

For further reading: see discussions of branch transformation and teller migration in global retail banking e.g. McKinsey’s “Reinventing the branch for the next normal” (https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-to-reinvent-branch-banking-for-a-digital-world) and similar work from Accenture and Deloitte.

**Sybrin implications (18‑month priority)**

Self‑service is where Sybrin can plug into a trend that is **already aligned** with:

- Its **branch network legacy** (59 solutions across 33 clients, severely underpriced but functionally embedded in day‑to‑day branch operations).    
- Its **payments and document workflows** (teller transactions, imaging, digital engagement, decentralised processing).    
- Its upcoming **e‑payment order (e‑check) and instant payments** initiatives.

Concretely, this suggests three alignment moves:

1. **Position the new branch network platform explicitly as a “self‑service & interaction orchestration layer.”**  
   - Extend the planned v2 branch platform so that it can:  
     - Accept transactions from self‑service devices and kiosks (as “virtual tellers”).  
     - Orchestrate document capture, KYC checks, fraud checks and approvals across teller, self‑service and mobile flows using the same workflow engine.  
     - Expose APIs/SDKs that ATM/ITM vendors and kiosk providers can use to integrate easily.  
   - This does not require Sybrin to build hardware or ATMs; it uses **existing strength in workflow, integration, imaging and branch operations**.

2. **Tie self‑service directly to e‑payment orders and instant payments.**  
   - As check decommissioning accelerates in Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and others, **customers still need branch‑anchored payment instruments** for BNPL, rentals, and government disbursements.    
   - Sybrin’s planned **electronic payment orders (EPOs)** can be:  
     - Initiated via teller, branch kiosks or mobile.  
     - Cashed or transferred via **self‑service at branch** (e.g., ATM or kiosk scanning a QR code) or assisted self‑service.  
   - This gives a **concrete, differentiating use case** for self‑service that ties directly to Sybrin’s largest legacy revenue streams.

3. **Use self‑service transformation as the commercial hook for branch repricing.**  
   - When Sybrin decommissions old branch network solutions and forces re‑procurement, it should sell the new platform as **“branch digitalisation and self‑service enablement”**, not just “version 2 of the old system”.    
   - Tangible benefits banks understand:  
     - Lower teller headcount or reallocation to advisory.  
     - Shorter queues and better NPS.  
     - Compliance and audit improvements via digital workflows.  
   - This gives banks a **business case** to accept higher pricing and project spend.

### 2.2. Universal banker / advisory roles

**Global trend**

- As routine transactions move to digital/self‑service, branches are repurposed for **sales, advice, SME support and complex servicing**.  
- Many banks move from a strict teller vs. platform split to **“universal banker” roles**, where front‑line staff:  
  - Handle both teller transactions and advice/sales in one visit.  
  - Use tablets or desktops with a unified workbench to see customer context, initiate workflows, and collaborate with specialists.  
- This shift can improve both revenue (more effective cross‑sell) and costs (leaner staffing), but typically requires:  
  - Integrated customer view and workflows.  
  - Flexible staffing and scheduling.  
  - Strong training and change management.

Examples are well documented across US and European banks; see, for instance, BCG’s work on “universal banker” models (https://www.bcg.com/publications/2015/retail-banking-universal-banker) and similar coverage by Cornerstone Advisors and Celent.

**Sybrin implications (18‑month and post‑exit)**

Sybrin should **not** attempt to build a full universal‑teller core platform or CRM before exit. But it can align with this trend in ways that:

- Turn its branch and C2B platforms into **the operational backbone** supporting universal banker workflows, particularly in mid‑tier African banks and inclusion‑focused Asian institutions.    
- Prepare a **compelling strategic narrative** for buyers about where the portfolio can go.

For the next 18 months, the highest‑leverage moves are:

1. **Add “advisory mode” capabilities into the new branch platform and C2B.**  
   - Build features that support how a universal banker works in practice without over‑engineering:  
     - Queue and appointment management that routes customers to staff based on skills (teller vs. SME adviser vs. mortgage specialist).  
     - In‑branch case/workflow management so that a customer interaction (complaint, application, onboarding) is tracked end‑to‑end.  
     - Hooks into Sybrin digital onboarding and fraud tools so advisers can originate new accounts, loans, and merchant relationships from the same front end.    
   - These can be light‑weight modules bolted onto existing capabilities rather than entirely new products.

2. **Use C2B as the corporate‑and‑SME “universal banker” interaction hub.**  
   - Corporate banking is a core focus for Sybrin’s new C2B solution.    
   - C2B can be positioned as the **front office for universal relationship managers** interacting with corporate and SME clients:  
     - Tracking all engagements, requests and documents.  
     - Combining digital self‑service (corporate portals) with relationship‑manager workflows.  
   - This aligns with global trends where corporate relationship managers play a universal/advisory role supported by collaboration tools rather than traditional “branch tellers”.

3. **Tell a clear “post‑exit” story about universal bankers in Emerging Markets.**  
   - Many African and Asian banks are **at an earlier stage** of this transition than Europe/US, but pressures are similar: cost efficiency, digital migration, inclusion mandates.  
   - Sybrin’s buyer will value a credible path where:  
     - Upgraded branch platforms + C2B + digital onboarding + Tazana/fraud underpin a **multi‑channel advisory model** across branch, field, and digital.    
     - Sybrin partners with CRM and core banking providers rather than competing with them.

### 2.3. Mobile tellers and field‑based staff

**Global trend**

- In many markets, especially emerging ones, “teller” functions are increasingly done **outside the branch** by:  
  - Staff or agents with tablets/phones visiting communities, markets and SMEs.  
  - Agents in small shops providing basic cash‑in/cash‑out and account services.  
  - Field‑based loan and collections officers.  
- This is particularly important where:  
  - Branch networks are sparse or being reduced.  
  - Regulators push for **financial inclusion**.  
  - Mobile money and fintech competitors are strong.

Examples include: Kenya’s agent banking models, India’s business correspondents, and the Philippines’ rural and thrift banking outreach; see, e.g., CGAP’s work on agent networks (https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/agents-reliable-partners-digital-financial-inclusion).

**Sybrin implications**

Sybrin is **already moving into this territory** through:

- **Digital onboarding and fraud management** being rolled out in the Philippines as a SaaS, low‑implementation solution for rural and thrift banks.    
- Use cases around **merchant onboarding** (street vendors, SMBs for card acceptance), which are inherently field‑based.    

For the next 18 months, mobile tellers should be treated as **a design and packaging pattern rather than a separate product line**:

1. **Ensure digital onboarding and fraud tools are optimised for mobile and offline/low‑bandwidth use.**  
   - This directly supports field staff and agents in the Philippines and, later, African MFIs/SACCOs and tier‑3 banks.    
   - It strengthens the **“financial inclusion” narrative** that resonates with donors like Gates and multilateral banks.    

2. **Link mobile/field workflows to branch and C2B platforms.**  
   - A mobile banker initiating onboarding or loan applications in the field should appear in the same workflow queues as branch or corporate‑portal requests.  
   - This reinforces Sybrin’s story as a **unified orchestration layer across branch, field and digital**.

3. **Use mobile teller capabilities as “proof” of scalability of the Philippines model to Africa.**  
   - Success with rural/thrift banks in the Philippines is explicitly intended as a testbed for serving MFIs/SACCOs and small banks in Africa via SaaS and transaction‑based pricing.    
   - From a buyer’s perspective, this becomes a **growth option**, not something Sybrin has to fully build out before exit.

## 3. Pulling it together: which trends matter *most* for Sybrin?

### 3.1. Priority ranking for alignment

Given Sybrin’s strategic constraints, installed base, and exit horizon, the relative importance is:

1. **Self‑service & assisted self‑service (highest priority, near‑term monetisable)**  
   - Directly supports:  
     - Branch repricing and v2 rollout.    
     - E‑payment orders and instant payments products.    
     - Immediate cost‑takeout and CX benefits for banks.  
   - Leverages existing strengths in **branch workflows, document capture, payments integration, and reliability**.    

2. **Universal banker/advisory roles (strategic medium‑term, light‑touch alignment now)**  
   - Near term: add minimal yet valuable “advisory mode” features into branch and C2B; position as **supporting the shift from teller to adviser**.  
   - Post‑exit: clear roadmap to deeper advisory capabilities via analytics and partnerships.  
   - Important for buyers because it tells a **“future branch” story** anchored in Sybrin’s existing assets.

3. **Mobile tellers / field‑based staff (selective, inclusion‑driven; framed as usage pattern)**  
   - Highly relevant in **Philippines, African MFIs/SACCOs, rural markets**, and donor‑funded inclusion programmes.    
   - Should be delivered by ensuring that digital onboarding, fraud, and branch workflows are **mobile‑optimised and agent‑friendly**, not by launching a large new “mobile teller” product line.  
   - Strategically important but **secondary to self‑service** in the 18‑month exit story.

### 3.2. How to talk about this to buyers and to banks

For buyers (exit narrative):

- “Sybrin owns critical branch and payments infrastructure across Africa and is now upgrading it into a **multi‑channel interaction hub** that orchestrates teller, self‑service, mobile and digital flows.  
- This hub underpins banks’ transition from traditional teller models to **self‑service‑first and advisory‑led branch networks**, and it is already being proven in an inclusion context in the Philippines, with a playbook for MFIs/SACCOs in Africa.”

For banks (client value proposition):

- “We help you **move transactions out of the teller line**, digitise your branch network and corporate interactions, and gradually transition your staff into **universal advisor roles**, while protecting legacy use cases (e.g., cheques → electronic payment orders) and complying with new regulations (instant payments, fraud).”

This framing keeps Sybrin tightly aligned with the most important global teller trends, without overreaching beyond what it can practically deliver before the planned exit.
