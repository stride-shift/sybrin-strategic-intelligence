# 1. Market Understanding & Decision Makers

## Question
Who are the real decision makers in banks (often not the formal title holders), and how do influence networks and cultural nuances affect buying decisions?

---

## Answer

## In a nutshell

In African and Philippine banks, the people who shape technology buying decisions are usually a **small senior core (CEO/MD, CIO/CTO, COO/Head of Operations, Chief Risk/Compliance)** plus a set of **informal influencers** (operations “fixers”, long‑tenured elders, technical experts, and sometimes family or group‑level owners). Formal titles and committees matter for signatures, but deals are won or lost in **informal influence networks shaped by hierarchy, consensus norms, and “face‑saving” politeness**. To sell effectively, Sybrin must map the *collective decision network* in each bank, not just the named decision maker, and adapt to local cultural patterns in each country cluster.

## 1. Who really makes decisions in banks?

### 1.1 Formal roles vs. real power

Across the research, four “hard power” roles appear over and over as decisive in technology and payments purchases:

- **CEO / Managing Director / Country CEO**  
  - In Tier 2/3 and smaller banks, the CEO often **directly decides** on technology spend and can approve outside normal budget cycles, especially in Uganda and other lower‑tier African banks.   
  - In family‑controlled Philippine banks and some African family banks, the “real” CEO may be the **family patriarch/matriarch or family board**; professional management executes but does not overrule family priorities.    

- **CIO / CTO / Head of Technology**  
  - Owns the **technical evaluation and recommendation** and can kill a deal on feasibility grounds.  
  - In more hierarchical markets (Philippines, Ghana, Mozambique), they rarely make the final call alone; they recommend to the CEO/board or group‑level CIO.    

- **COO / Head of Operations / Head of Branch Network**  
  - Often the **hidden economic buyer** for payment processing, teller, and branch automation because they feel the operational pain.  
  - Their “this will fix my cutoff problems / queue times / reconciliation nightmare” is what convinces the CEO to sign. This pattern is explicit in multiple country GTM pieces (Tanzania, Mozambique).    

- **CRO / Head of Risk / Compliance / Internal Audit**  
  - Holds a **strong veto** on anything touching fraud, KYC, instant payments, and data.  
  - Deals anchored on regulatory drivers (fraud mandates, TIPS, BoT/BSP rules, etc.) only close when Risk/Compliance explicitly supports the choice.    

On top of this, **boards and parent groups** often have final authority:

- **Board of Directors**  
  - Major technology programs (core replacements, payment hubs, multi‑year upgrades) almost always need board approval in Tier 1 and many Tier 2 banks (Uganda, Botswana, Namibia, etc.).     
- **Parent‑group CIO / Group Digital / Group COO**  
  - For subsidiaries (FNB/FirstRand, Standard Bank, ABSA, Nedbank, etc.), **group‑level technology leadership can override local preferences** and standardize platforms across countries, as highlighted in Namibia and Mozambique analyses.    

**Practical implication:** In enterprise and Tier 1/Tier 2 banks, the *signature* sits with CEO/Board/group CIO, but the **go/no‑go recommendation** is usually a coalition of CIO, Operations, and Risk/Compliance.

---

### 1.2 Informal influencers and “shadow power”

Beyond formal roles, several recurring informal power centers decide whether a deal actually flies:

1. **Long‑tenured “elder statesmen” (or women)**  
   - In Botswana, the cultural legacy of the *kgotla* means age and seniority carry enormous weight, even beyond formal title. Sales guidance explicitly advises identifying “who has been with the bank longest in technology” because their endorsement signals safety to others.    
   - Similar deference to elders and seniority appears in Ethiopia, Malawi, Zambia, and Namibia due to high power distance and Ubuntu/collectivist norms.     

2. **Operations “fixers” and technical experts**  
   - These are often **mid‑level managers or senior engineers** who keep the current system running. Their informal veto is powerful: “this will never integrate with our switch” can quietly kill a project long before board stage.  
   - Malawi guidance explicitly highlights junior technical specialists whose opinion seniors trust; Sybrin is told to watch who others defer to in meetings.   

3. **Risk & Compliance “guardians”**  
   - Even when not formally on the steering committee, Risk or Compliance officers often act as **gatekeepers**, especially on fraud/KYC/instant payments. Uganda and Ethiopia strategies emphasize that failing to secure early buy‑in from Risk means late‑stage veto on “too risky/not compliant”.    

4. **Family / owner influence (Philippines and some African banks)**  
   - Many Philippine banks sit inside **family‑controlled conglomerates**; boards dominated by family members keep strategic control while professional managers run operations. Vendors must win both the professional C‑suite and the family board by aligning with the family’s long‑term reputation and risk appetite.   
   - Similar patterns exist in family‑owned African banks and Ethiopian private banks, where family reputation, religious networks, and in‑group trust can outweigh purely economic arguments.   

5. **Association and central‑bank networks**  
   - In Namibia, the **Bankers Association of Namibia** emerges as a high‑value relationship point because it provides access to all major bank CEOs.   
   - In Ethiopia, regulators like the National Bank of Ethiopia and national schemes such as EthSwitch shape what is “acceptable”; vendors seen as the regulator’s or scheme’s trusted partner gain disproportionate influence.    

6. **Alumni / educational networks**  
   - Cultural reports note that graduates of key universities (Stellenbosch, Add­­is Ababa University, UP/Ateneo/DLSU in the Philippines) form influence networks; shared education backgrounds often unlock trust and introductions.     

**Bottom line:** “The real decision makers” are a **coalition**:  
- Formal: CEO/Board/group CIO + CIO/CTO + COO + CRO/Compliance.  
- Informal: elder statesmen, key technical operators, risk guardians, family owners, and association/regulator networks.

## 2. How influence networks work by segment and tier

### 2.1 Tier 1 & large Tier 2 banks (Africa and Philippines)

In these institutions, decisions are **committee‑driven**, but the composition and culture differ by market cluster.

**Common structural pattern:**

- **Economic buyer(s):** CEO/MD, sometimes Chief Digital Officer (for digital banking, instant payments).   
- **Technical authority:** CIO/CTO/IT Director and senior architects.  
- **Risk authority:** CRO/Head of Compliance/Internal Audit for anything touching payments, fraud, data, or regulatory reporting.  
- **User owners:** COO, Head of Operations, Head of Branch Network, Head of Corporate Banking (for C2B, treasury, trade).  
- **Governance:** Executive Committee + Board or Board sub‑committee (Risk/IT/Transformation).  

**Process characteristics:**

- Formal RFPs, **multiple evaluations**, and cross‑functional committees (IT, Ops, Risk, Finance).  
- Strong weight on **references from similar‑sized banks** and group peers. Ugandan Tier 1 banks, for example, want proof from Kenya/Tanzania peers at similar scale.   
- **Regulatory triggers** (instant payments mandates, fraud rules, ISO 20022 migrations) often create the internal urgency that aligns this coalition.    

For Philippine Tier 1 and big universal banks, the research stresses **extreme power distance and family control**:

- “Only engage C‑suite and family board” for major decisions; mid‑level managers will not commit and may be offended if treated as decision makers.    
- Final go/no‑go likely decided in **closed‑door family/board sessions**, with professional CIO and COO providing input but not ultimate authority.

### 2.2 Tier 2/3 banks and MFIs

The decision structure flattens, but influence networks still matter:

- In Uganda’s Tier 2 banks, the **CEO is directly involved** in technology decisions, with fewer stakeholders and faster cycles (3–12 months). Cost‑effectiveness and quick implementation weigh heavily.   
- In microfinance institutions and small banks, decisions often come down to **CEO + IT Manager**, with informal procurement and heavy price sensitivity, but still with Risk/Compliance expectations around regulatory needs.   
- In rural/thrift banks in the Philippines, professional managers run operations but are constrained by **family or board appetite for SaaS and vendor risk**; donor‑funded programs (e.g., Gates’ Tazana) can temporarily override budget constraints and shift power towards the project sponsor.    

**Implication for Sybrin:**  
Smaller institutions mean **fewer people to win**, but the **CEO and a small trusted circle** (IT, Operations, maybe Risk) must be aligned; generic IT selling to a lone “Head of Technology” is high‑risk.

## 3. How cultural nuances shape influence and buying decisions

The cross‑country framework groups markets by power distance and hierarchy; this is critical to predicting who really decides and how to approach them.   

### 3.1 Very high hierarchy, top‑down (Philippines, Ghana, Mozambique)

- **Cultural traits:**  
  - Very high power distance: authority is concentrated at the top; questioning seniors is rare.  
  - Formality: titles, surnames, protocol matter.  
  - Decision style: **top‑down, often family/board‑centric** for banks inside conglomerates.    

- **Implications:**  
  - You **must start at the top**: CEO, Board, family stakeholders; building mid‑level coalitions is mostly a waste of time and can be seen as disrespectful.   
  - Buying criteria emphasise **reputation, safety, and alignment with the institution’s status and risk appetite**, not just functionality.  
  - “Yes” from a mid‑level manager often means only “we will listen”; it is not a commitment.

### 3.2 High hierarchy with consultative overlay (Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Malawi)

- **Cultural traits:**  
  - High power distance, strong collectivism; respect for elders and authority.    
  - Decisions made by seniors but **consulting key juniors and peers**; harmony and consensus within the hierarchy matter.     

- **Implications:**  
  - Sybrin must **engage C‑suite early**, but also deliberately build support with Operations, IT, and Risk for their input and endorsement.  
  - Malawi and Ethiopia guidance stresses mapping the **collective decision network**: who must be “comfortable” with the approach, not just who signs.    
  - Indirect communication and “face‑saving” mean lack of explicit enthusiasm or follow‑through is often a polite “no”. Sybrin is advised to test interest with specific next steps and read non‑actions as negative signals.   

### 3.3 Hierarchical but consensus‑driven (Botswana, Namibia, some Southern Africa)

- **Cultural traits:**  
  - Hierarchical on paper, but **consensus‑oriented** in practice (Botswana’s kgotla tradition, Namibian Ubuntu/collectivism).    
  - Strong respect for seniors, formal titles, and age; indirect communication to preserve harmony.  

- **Implications:**  
  - The **“decision maker” is the group** assembled around the CIO/CEO, not an individual. Botswana guidance explicitly tells Sybrin to map the “kgotla”: IT, Operations, Risk/Compliance, Finance, branch leaders, and perhaps a board sponsor.   
  - Group meetings are more effective than serial one‑to‑ones; they align with local consensus norms and accelerate agreement.   
  - Ignoring a long‑tenured elder or treating juniors as primary decision makers can stall or kill deals.

### 3.4 Lower hierarchy / more egalitarian (South Africa, Uganda)

- **Cultural traits:**  
  - Moderate power distance; more democratic/consultative decision‑making, especially in South Africa and some Ugandan banks.    
- **Implications:**  
  - Coalition‑building across levels (C‑suite + mid‑management + technical) is not just acceptable, it is expected.  
  - Mid‑level champions (e.g., a Head of Digital Channels) can meaningfully drive the process and influence the CEO/Board if they present a strong business case.

---

## 4. How these dynamics affect Sybrin’s ability to qualify and close

### 4.1 Qualification: spotting real interest vs politeness

Multiple cultural reports emphasize **politeness and indirectness**, especially in Malawi, Botswana, and the Philippines. This creates a consistent pattern:

- Warm words and “this is very interesting” are **not reliable signals**.  
- The most reliable buying signals are **behavioural**:
  - The prospect introduces Sybrin to additional stakeholders (Ops, Risk, Finance).    
  - They share concrete details: budget ranges, board cycles, previous project decision paths.   
  - They agree to specific next steps (pilot scope, technical workshop) and follow through.   

Where these behaviours do not appear, the guidance is to treat it as a polite “no” and re‑qualify or exit.

### 4.2 Mapping the decision network (not just a champion)

Several country playbooks give a similar pattern for uncovering the real buying group:

- Ask **process‑oriented questions**, not “who decides?”  
  - “When you implemented [national switch / last major system], which teams were involved and how did the process work?”    
  - “For a digital onboarding transformation of this magnitude, who typically needs to be comfortable with the approach?”   
- From the answers, identify:
  - **Formal authority:** MD/CEO, Executive Committee, Board.  
  - **Technical influence:** IT, Operations.  
  - **Risk veto:** Risk, Compliance, Finance.  
  - **Cultural authority:** longest‑tenured senior person (“elder”).    

Sybrin’s own internal strategy docs explicitly warn that treating “Head of Technology” as sole decision maker leads to surprises when Board/Risk veto late in the cycle. 

### 4.3 Tailoring engagement by market cluster (from the 80/20 framework)

The 80‑20 African market entry framework boils this down into practical tactics:   

- **Cluster 6 (very high hierarchical: Philippines, Mozambique, Ghana)**  
  - Engage only C‑suite and board/family; mid‑level staff will not commit.  
  - Use maximum formality and structured presentations; target top‑down approval.  
- **Cluster 7 (high hierarchical with consultation: Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Malawi)**  
  - Engage C‑suite but deliberately bring in technical and operations staff for recommendations.  
  - Manage both hierarchy and consensus in your deal strategy.  
- **Cluster 8 (moderate hierarchical: Zambia, Namibia)**  
  - Blend top‑level sponsorship with director‑level champions.  
- **Cluster 9 (lower hierarchical: South Africa, Uganda)**  
  - Build broad coalitions across levels; mid‑level managers can be strong allies.

## 5. Time‑horizon implications for Sybrin

### 5.1 18‑month exit window (to ~Q1 2027)

In the exit timeline, the goal is **maximising conversion and predictability** of deals in priority geographies (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Philippines).

Key actions that leverage decision‑maker insights:

- **Institution‑level decision maps for top 30–50 accounts.**  
  - For each priority bank: explicitly document the real decision network (formal signatories, informal influencers, risk veto points, group/board roles). This draws on the stakeholder mapping methods documented for Malawi, Botswana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.       
- **Cluster‑specific playbooks for sales execution.**  
  - Implement the cluster‑based engagement guidance (who to approach first, how formal, group vs 1:1) from the 80/20 framework in live pipeline management.   
- **Qualification discipline around politeness cultures.**  
  - Train sales teams to interpret “polite interest vs real intent” using the behavioural tests in the Malawi and Botswana GTM reports. This should reduce “phantom pipeline” and increase forecast accuracy before exit.    

This does not require being “a different company”; it is about executing the existing strategy with sharper stakeholder mapping and culturally aligned engagement to hit revenue and EBITDA targets.

### 5.2 Longer‑term, post‑exit view

Post‑exit, deeper institutionalisation of these insights would support sustainable growth:

- **Always‑on decision‑maker intelligence.**  
  - Maintain living decision‑maker maps by country and by group (ABSA, FirstRand, Ecobank, Access Bank), tracking executive moves and alumni networks, as illustrated in the Namibia decision‑maker intelligence work.   
- **Embedding cultural intelligence in product and partner strategy.**
  - Use what has been learned about hierarchy, consensus, and trust to choose where to lead with SaaS, where to rely on local SIs, and how to structure donor‑backed programs that shift power dynamics (e.g., Gates in the Philippines).
