# Higher-Level Jobs Analysis: Fundamental Jobs from Operational Evidence

**Question**: The current JTBD analysis has operational-level jobs like "Scale digital user base 5-10x without proportional increase in fraud losses, customer service staff, or operational costs." What are the more fundamental jobs at a higher abstraction level?

**Why this matters**: By shifting abstraction level, we can identify white space that's invisible at the operational level.

**Methodology**: Analyze the 9 functional jobs to identify job families, then abstract to fundamental jobs.

**Date**: November 17, 2025

## Job Abstraction Framework

In JTBD theory, jobs exist at different levels of abstraction:

| Level | Example | Characteristics |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Specific** | "Meet BSP AFASA real-time fraud mandate by 2025 without breaking IT budget" | Geography/regulation-specific, time-bound, solution-hinting |
| **Operational** | "Comply with new regulatory requirements without major IT investment" | Generalizable across contexts, still focused on HOW |
| **Fundamental** | "Navigate regulatory change without disruption" | Universal, focused on outcome/WHY |
| **Meta** | "Compete successfully despite incumbent constraints" | Cross-cutting pattern across multiple fundamental jobs |

Higher abstraction = broader solution space = more white space opportunities

## Part 1: Current Job Families (Grouping the 9 Operational Jobs)

### Family A: Regulatory Adaptation Jobs

**Operational jobs**:
- Job 1: Meet BSP AFASA real-time fraud mandate by 2025 without breaking IT budget
- Job 2: Navigate check decommissioning without losing revenue or customers

**Pattern**: External regulator imposes new requirement; we must adapt without disrupting existing business.

**Higher-level job**: **Navigate regulatory change without disruption to operations or economics**

**Even more fundamental**: **Turn regulatory mandates into competitive advantage**

**Why this abstraction matters**:
- At operational level, solutions are compliance tools (fraud platforms, payment systems)
- At fundamental level, solutions include:
  - Regulatory intelligence (predict changes before mandated)
  - First-mover positioning (comply early, differentiate vs. late adopters)
  - Regulatory-as-moat (use compliance to create barriers for competitors)
  - Lobbying/shaping (influence regulation before it's finalized)

**White space revealed**:
- **Regulatory future-proofing** - subscription service that monitors 50+ regulators across markets and alerts you 12-24 months before mandates hit
- **Compliance-as-differentiation** - marketing services that turn "we're compliant" into "we're safer/better"

---

### Family B: Profitable Scaling Jobs

**Operational jobs**:
- Job 3: Reach 98% self-service transactions without losing the 20% of customers who can't/won't go digital
- Job 4: Manage 6M+ digital users with same operational capacity as 1M users

**Pattern**: Grow volume/scale while improving (not just maintaining) economics.

**Higher-level job**: **Achieve operational leverage as we scale**

**Even more fundamental**: **Grow profitably despite diminishing returns**

**Why this abstraction matters**:
- At operational level, solutions are automation tools (chatbots, AI fraud, self-service UX)
- At fundamental level, solutions include:
  - Customer profitability selection (only acquire profitable customers)
  - Value-based pricing (charge more for high-cost segments)
  - Network effects (customer acquisition becomes cheaper at scale)
  - Platform business models (shift to marketplace where customers serve each other)

**White space revealed**:
- **Profitability-based customer routing** - customers who need high-touch service are automatically routed to premium tiers (self-funding)
- **Customer co-production platforms** - power users help novice users (community support reduces cost-to-serve)

---

### Family C: Difficult Segment Profitability Jobs

**Operational jobs**:
- Job 5: Serve 90% rural clients profitably when connectivity is poor and field officers travel 100km on bikes
- Job 6: Manage 329 Micro Banking Offices with same oversight as 54 branches
- Job 9: Digitize 32,000 agents without losing agent productivity or creating fraud exposure

**Pattern**: Serve low-density, hard-to-reach, high-cost-to-serve customers profitably.

**Higher-level job**: **Serve unprofitable segments profitably through operational innovation**

**Even more fundamental**: **Make financial inclusion economically sustainable** (not just mission-driven)

**Why this abstraction matters**:
- At operational level, solutions are offline tools, mobile tech, agent platforms
- At fundamental level, solutions include:
  - Cross-subsidy models (profitable urban customers subsidize rural)
  - Shared infrastructure (multiple MFIs share agent network, field officers, branches)
  - Community-based service delivery (customers become distribution)
  - Microwork platforms (rural agents do digital tasks during downtime to monetize idle capacity)

**White space revealed**:
- **Shared rural infrastructure** - consortium model where 5-10 MFIs share 329 MBOs, field officers, agents (cost/institution drops 80%)
- **Agent capacity marketplace** - Zanaco's 32k agents do KYC verification for 3 other banks during idle time (agents earn more, bank spreads fixed costs)

---

### Family D: Legacy Infrastructure Competition Jobs

**Operational jobs**:
- Job 7: Connect to TIPS without replacing our core banking system
- Job 8: Process InstaPay/PESONet at scale without building expensive real-time infrastructure

**Pattern**: Compete with digital-native players despite having legacy systems they don't have.

**Higher-level job**: **Participate in digital infrastructure without transformation**

**Even more fundamental**: **Turn legacy constraints into competitive advantages**

**Why this abstraction matters**:
- At operational level, solutions are middleware, facades, payment gateways
- At fundamental level, solutions include:
  - Legacy-as-compliance-moat (digital banks lack the regulatory track record we have)
  - Legacy-as-customer-trust (customers prefer "real bank" over "app bank")
  - Legacy-as-partnership-asset (fintechs want our banking license/balance sheet, we want their tech)
  - Legacy-as-data-advantage (we have 20 years of customer data; they have 2 years)

**White space revealed**:
- **Legacy bank as platform** - instead of competing with fintechs, become infrastructure for fintechs (rent them our license, compliance, balance sheet; they rent us their UX/speed)
- **Trust arbitrage** - position legacy systems as "battle-tested security" vs. "unproven cloud-native" (turn constraint into feature)

---

## Part 2: Meta-Level Fundamental Jobs (Cross-Cutting Patterns)

When we look across ALL four job families, what's the most fundamental job?

### Meta Job 1: Compete successfully despite incumbent constraints

**Evidence**: Every single job involves constraints that:
- Incumbents have (regulatory burden, legacy tech, branch networks, compliance costs, geographic mandates)
- Digital-native competitors DON'T have (they start clean, no legacy, no physical infrastructure, lighter regulation)

**Current framing**: Jobs are about "overcoming" or "working around" constraints
- "Navigate regulatory change" = regulatory burden is constraint to overcome
- "Achieve operational leverage" = cost structure is constraint to overcome
- "Serve difficult segments profitably" = geography/inclusion mandate is constraint to overcome
- "Participate in digital infrastructure without transformation" = legacy tech is constraint to overcome

**Reframed fundamental job**: **Turn incumbent disadvantages into competitive advantages**

This reframing opens entirely different solution spaces:
- Instead of "work around legacy core," → "leverage legacy core as trust signal, compliance moat, or partnership asset"
- Instead of "reduce branch costs," → "turn branches into fintech partnership distribution, community anchors, or premium service hubs"
- Instead of "comply with regulation," → "use regulation to drive competitor exit or create barriers to entry"

---

### Meta Job 2: Grow and compete when we're asset-heavy and competitors are asset-light

**Evidence**: The pattern across all jobs is:
- We have physical infrastructure (branches, agents, field officers, ATMs)
- We have regulatory infrastructure (licenses, compliance teams, audit history)
- We have legacy technology infrastructure (cores, data centers, integrations)
- Competitors (fintechs, digital banks, e-wallets) have NONE of this

**Current framing**: Infrastructure is cost/burden
**Reframed fundamental job**: **Monetize existing infrastructure to compete with asset-light players**

Solution space shift:
- **Infrastructure as product**: Sell/rent our infrastructure to competitors (like AWS)
  - Example: Rent our agent network to GCash (they get last-mile distribution, we get fee income + data)
  - Example: Rent our banking license to fintechs (they get regulatory cover, we get revenue share)
  - Example: Rent our core banking system excess capacity to Tier 3 banks (multi-tenant our legacy)

- **Infrastructure as moat**: Position infrastructure as competitive barrier
  - Example: "We have 329 MBOs in rural Philippines; digital banks can never match this"
  - Example: "We have 20 years of fraud data; AI models from 2-year-old fintechs are inferior"

---

### Meta Job 3: Satisfy stakeholders with conflicting demands

**Evidence**: Hidden in the operational jobs are stakeholder conflicts:
- Board wants profitability (cost cutting) vs. regulator wants inclusion (serve unprofitable rural)
- Regulator wants compliance (expensive tech upgrades) vs. shareholders want ROI
- Customers want digital convenience vs. elderly customers need branches
- Staff want job security vs. automation improves margins

**Current framing**: Jobs are about optimizing single objective
- "Reach 98% digital" = maximize digital %
- "Serve rural profitably" = maximize rural ROI

**Reframed fundamental job**: **Simultaneously satisfy contradictory stakeholder demands**

Solution space shift:
- **Stakeholder arbitrage platforms**: Tools that show different stakeholders that their demands are being met
  - Board dashboard: "Cost-to-income improved 15%"
  - Regulator dashboard: "Financial inclusion accounts increased 20%"
  - Same underlying actions, different framing

- **Trade-off automation**: AI that optimizes multi-objective functions in real-time
  - "Maximize profitability subject to regulatory compliance and customer satisfaction constraints"
  - Continuously rebalance (vs. manual strategic planning)

---

## Part 3: White Space Revealed by Higher Abstraction

### White Space Category 1: Platform Business Models (Not Tools)

**From**: "Serve 329 MBOs with same oversight as 54 branches" (operational)
**To**: "Turn incumbent infrastructure into platform revenue" (meta)

**New solution**: **MFI Infrastructure Marketplace**
- CARD Bank's 329 MBOs become shared infrastructure for 10 other MFIs
- CARD operates as platform; other MFIs are tenants
- MBOs become multi-tenant (serve customers from 5 different MFIs)
- CARD's fixed costs drop 60% (shared across 10 institutions)
- Revenue model: Platform fees from tenant MFIs

**Why invisible at operational level**: Operational jobs assume "we serve our customers." Platform models assume "we serve customers AND competitors."

---

### White Space Category 2: Regulatory Arbitrage Services

**From**: "Navigate regulatory change without disruption" (fundamental)
**To**: "Turn regulation into competitive advantage" (meta)

**New solution**: **Compliance-as-Moat Consulting**
- Help Tier 1/2 banks use regulation to drive Tier 3/fintech competitors out
- Example: Lobby BSP to require AFASA for ALL institutions (including e-wallets)
  - GCash/Maya would face huge compliance costs
  - Tier 1 banks already compliant = no incremental cost
  - Result: Regulation becomes barrier to entry for competitors
- Revenue model: Success fees when competitor market share declines

**Why invisible at operational level**: Compliance tools help YOU comply. Regulatory arbitrage helps you weaponize regulation against competitors.

---

### White Space Category 3: Trust Monetization Platforms

**From**: "Participate in digital infrastructure without transformation" (fundamental)
**To**: "Turn legacy constraints into competitive advantages" (meta)

**New solution**: **Legacy Bank as Trust Infrastructure**
- Position legacy banks as "trust layer" for fintech ecosystem
- Fintechs have great UX but customers don't trust them (no deposit insurance, no track record, no physical presence)
- Legacy banks have trust but poor UX
- **Solution**: White-label trust services
  - Fintech customers see fintech brand/UX
  - But deposits actually held at legacy bank (deposit insurance, regulatory oversight)
  - Legacy bank provides fraud protection, dispute resolution, regulatory compliance
  - Fintech pays 1-2% of assets under management for trust services
- Revenue model: Asset-based fees (like custody banking)

**Why invisible at operational level**: Operational solutions are about internal efficiency. This is about monetizing intangible assets (trust, reputation, regulatory standing).

---

### White Space Category 4: Constraint Exchanges

**From**: "Serve unprofitable segments profitably" (fundamental)
**To**: "Grow and compete when we're asset-heavy and competitors are asset-light" (meta)

**New solution**: **Asset-Light/Asset-Heavy Exchange Platform**
- Asset-heavy banks have: Branches, agents, licenses, compliance, customer trust, data history
- Asset-light fintechs have: Fast development, modern UX, cloud scalability, low costs
- **Platform connects them for mutual advantage**:
  - Banks rent "heavy assets" to fintechs (agent network, branches for cash-in/out, banking license, fraud models)
  - Fintechs rent "light capabilities" to banks (UX design, cloud infrastructure, development speed)
- Revenue model: Exchange takes 10-15% of transaction value between parties

**Example**:
- GCash needs 32k agent network for cash-in → rents Zanaco's 32k agents
- Zanaco needs better mobile banking UX → rents GCash's development team for 3-month sprint
- Both win, platform captures value

**Why invisible at operational level**: Operational jobs assume competition. This assumes collaboration/exchange between competitors.

---

### White Space Category 5: Stakeholder Dashboard Intelligence

**From**: "Simultaneously satisfy contradictory stakeholder demands" (meta)

**New solution**: **Multi-Stakeholder Optimization Platform**
- Problem: Board wants profitability, regulators want inclusion, customers want convenience, staff want jobs
- Current solution: Strategic planning (annual, manual, political)
- **New solution**: Real-time stakeholder demand balancing
  - Platform ingests signals from all stakeholders:
    - Board signals: Stock price, analyst reports, shareholder letters
    - Regulator signals: Examination findings, policy announcements, enforcement actions
    - Customer signals: NPS, complaints, social media sentiment
    - Staff signals: Turnover, engagement surveys, union activity
  - AI optimizes decisions to balance stakeholder satisfaction
  - Executive dashboard shows "stakeholder satisfaction portfolio" (like investment portfolio)
  - Alerts when one stakeholder is becoming dangerously unsatisfied

**Revenue model**: SaaS platform for multi-stakeholder institutions (banks, utilities, governments)

**Why invisible at operational level**: Operational jobs are single-stakeholder focused. This is multi-stakeholder portfolio optimization.

## Part 4: Comparison of White Space at Different Abstraction Levels

| Abstraction Level | Example Job | White Space Solution | Market Size |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Operational** | "Manage 6M digital users with same operational capacity as 1M users" | AI fraud platform, chatbots | $10-50M (single product) |
| **Fundamental** | "Achieve operational leverage as we scale" | Customer profitability routing, co-production platforms | $100-500M (platform) |
| **Meta** | "Turn incumbent constraints into competitive advantages" | Legacy bank as trust infrastructure for fintechs | $1-10B (ecosystem play) |

**Pattern**: Higher abstraction = larger addressable market = more strategic value = harder to execute

## Part 5: Strategic Implications for Sybrin

### For 18-Month Exit (Q1 2027)

**Emphasize**: Operational-level solutions
- Tizana for AFASA (Job 1)
- Payment switches for TIPS/InstaPay (Jobs 7, 8)
- Agent digitization (Job 9)

**Why**: Operational solutions are fastest to revenue, easiest to explain to acquirers.

**Avoid**: Meta-level white space (platform business models, regulatory arbitrage)
**Why**: Too long to prove, too complex for exit story.

---

### For Post-Exit Growth

**Invest**: Fundamental-level white space
1. **Legacy bank as trust infrastructure** (White Space Category 3)
   - Partner with 5 fintechs to provide trust services
   - Proof: 1 fintech partnership generating $2M annual recurring revenue
   - Expansion: 50 fintechs across markets = $100M ARR

2. **MFI Infrastructure Marketplace** (White Space Category 1)
   - Launch with CARD Bank 329 MBOs as pilot
   - Sign 3 tenant MFIs in Year 1
   - Expansion: 20 MFI platforms across 10 countries

**Why**: Fundamental-level solutions create defensible moats, higher margins, network effects.

---

### For Long-Term Transformation

**Explore**: Meta-level white space
1. **Asset-Light/Asset-Heavy Exchange Platform**
   - Build marketplace where banks and fintechs trade capabilities
   - Revenue potential: 10-15% of billions in inter-party transactions

2. **Multi-Stakeholder Optimization Platform**
   - AI-powered stakeholder satisfaction balancing
   - TAM: Every regulated multi-stakeholder institution globally

**Why**: Meta-level solutions are category-creating, highly defensible, massive TAM.
**Risk**: Long time to market, requires ecosystem orchestration.

## Conclusion: The Power of Job Abstraction

The **same customer evidence** reveals different white space depending on abstraction level:

**Operational question**: "How do we help CARD Bank manage 329 MBOs efficiently?"
→ White space: Micro-branch management software ($5M opportunity)

**Fundamental question**: "How do we help MFIs serve rural segments profitably?"
→ White space: Shared MFI infrastructure platform ($100M opportunity)

**Meta question**: "How do we help asset-heavy institutions compete with asset-light competitors?"
→ White space: Infrastructure monetization marketplace ($1B+ opportunity)

**All three are valid**. The right abstraction level depends on:
- Time horizon (18 months vs. 5 years)
- Risk tolerance (proven vs. category-creating)
- Competitive moat desired (feature vs. platform vs. ecosystem)
- Strategic positioning (vendor vs. platform vs. orchestrator)

**For Sybrin**:
- **Now (18-month exit)**: Operational-level white space
- **Next (post-exit growth)**: Fundamental-level white space
- **Future (long-term transformation)**: Meta-level white space
