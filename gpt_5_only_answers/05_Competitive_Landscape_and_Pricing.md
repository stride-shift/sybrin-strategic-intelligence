# 2. Competitive Landscape & Pricing

## Question
How should Sybrin price Smart Teller and Payments upgrades, knowing existing clients may be forced into tenders when required to re-buy?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
Sybrin should treat Smart Teller and Payments upgrades as *strategic re‑pricing events*, not normal maintenance, and use a **tiered “value + risk” pricing framework**: low-friction upgrade paths and incentives for in‑life clients; full “new-sale” economics (and margins) once a client is forced into a tender. Commercially, that means **modular subscription bundles, explicit lifecycle-based uplift, and “tender-proof” reference pricing**, while keeping options that reduce the risk of clients churning in a forced re-buy.

## 1. Time Horizons: How the exit changes the pricing answer

### 18‑month exit view (to ~Q1 2027)

For the exit, buyers will look at:

- **Revenue uplift from repriced legacy assets.** The 59 branch/Smart Teller-type solutions across 33 clients yielding only ~ZAR 10m p.a. are a major underpricing anomaly; getting even part of the way to a market rate materially improves ARR and valuation  .  
- **Quality and durability of annuity revenue.** They will discount any uplift that looks like a one-off “price gouge” that could be reversed; they will pay more for clearly structured lifecycle policies that institutionalize regular upgrade fees.  
- **Churn risk triggered by upgrades.** Forcing clients into tenders is a double-edged sword. If too aggressive, it may spook buyers (high churn risk in the base).  
- **Evidence of scalable SaaS economics.** The Philippines model (low project fees + subscriptions/transactional pricing) and transaction-based models (e-check/EPO, instant payments) are what SaaS-focused acquirers want to see  .

So in the next 18 months, pricing of Smart Teller and Payments upgrades should aim to:

- Lock in **visible, recurring uplift** on a significant proportion of the 90–100 legacy solutions still to be upgraded.  
- Demonstrate a **repeatable lifecycle-based upgrade model**, not ad hoc negotiations.  
- Minimize **headline churn** from forced re-buys, even if that means selective “grandfathering” for key reference banks.

### Longer-term view (post-exit)

Post-exit, the optimal strategy is more aggressive:

- Standardize on **full SaaS / subscription pricing** for Smart Teller and Payments, with transaction-based elements where possible (e.g., EPO / instant payments).  
- Use lifecycle policy and modularity to **normalize re-buys** every few years (aligned with version and security cycles), so upgrades become predictable revenue events rather than crises.  
- Gradually **withdraw legacy concessions** and harmonize pricing across regions and clients as buyer confidence in the product suite grows.

The recommendations below lean toward what can realistically be implemented **before** exit and still look credible and scalable **after** exit.

## 2. Pricing Principles for Smart Teller & Payments Upgrades

Given Sybrin’s context, four principles should govern upgrade pricing:

1. **Value-based anchoring with explicit “new vs. legacy” framing.**  
   Clients on 15–20-year-old contracts paying 18% maintenance on a tiny base know they are underpaying relative to modern alternatives  . Sybrin should make the *value delta* of the new platform explicit (security, web deployment, new functionality, future roadmap) and frame upgrade pricing as a **partial catch-up to today’s market price**, not a tweak to maintenance.

2. **Lifecycle discipline, not arbitrary enforcement.**  
   The software lifecycle policy (must stay within 3 versions / 3 years, or face termination/penalties) should be *the* foundation for upgrade pricing  . If clients see clear, published rules, forced tenders feel like a *consequence of policy*, not a commercial ambush.

3. **Tiered paths that avoid unnecessary tenders.**  
   Banking procurement often requires a tender when: (a) scope/contract changes materially, or (b) spend crosses a threshold. Sybrin should design **“upgrade paths” that keep some clients under tender thresholds** (with staged uplift and options), while deliberately accepting tenders in accounts where it wants to reset economics or displace weak incumbents.

4. **Protect the strategic base, sweat the rest.**  
   Not all 33 underpriced branch/teller clients are equal. Some are anchor logos, pan-African groups, or gateways to new regions (e.g., Ghana, Malawi, Zambia)  . For these, Sybrin should lean more toward **defensive pricing** with strong cross-sell. For others, it can tolerate higher tender risk to unlock bigger price corrections.

## 3. A Concrete Pricing Framework

### 3.1 Define four commercial archetypes

Economically, there are four typical scenarios for Smart Teller / Payments upgrades:

1. **In-life upgrade (no tender triggered).**  
   Client is within lifecycle policy, upgrade is planned, and incremental spend is modest.

2. **Lifecycle breach where client cooperates (soft enforcement).**  
   Client is out-of-policy but willing to follow a recommended path if given time/options.

3. **Forced re-buy with tender (hard enforcement).**  
   Product is formally decommissioned or severely out of policy; client invokes tender rules.

4. **Greenfield / new product sale.**  
   Client is buying Smart Teller v2 or instant payments as a new purchase (no legacy baggage).

Sybrin should explicitly price and package for each archetype.

---

### 3.2 Archetype 1 – In-life upgrades: “Protected uplift”

Objective: **Achieve steady, low-risk uplift** on a broad base without triggering tenders.

Recommended approach:

- **Bundle license uplift into maintenance as a “modernization premium.”**  
  For clients upgrading within policy, increase their annual fee by, say, **10–25%** over 2–3 years (depending on underpricing level), rather than a single shock. This builds on the recent ~15% price increase cycle that clients have already absorbed  .

- **Package upgrades as security & compliance mandatory releases.**  
  Emphasize that older client-server frameworks are now security liabilities (which many banks’ scans are already flagging) and that the uplift is a “secure web” compliance charge, not a purely commercial one  .

- **Offer modular, opt-in features at premium price.**  
  For Smart Teller v2, mirror the C2B model: 3–4 modules (e.g., core teller, imaging/workflow, branch operations dashboards, digital engagement)  .  
  - Keep the **base module uplift moderate**.  
  - Price **add-on modules at high margin** to increase ARPU without touching tender triggers.

- **Lock in minimum terms.**  
  Tie the upgrade to a **3–5-year term** commitment at the new rate (with CPI+ escalations). This improves exit valuation by increasing revenue visibility.

---

### 3.3 Archetype 2 – Lifecycle breach but cooperative: “Carrots before sticks”

Objective: **Move out-of-policy clients forward without immediately forcing a tender.**

Steps:

- **Publish a clear upgrade menu with dated deadlines.**  
  For example, “Upgrade before 31 March 2026 to qualify for Route A pricing; after that, legacy support fees jump by X% or contracts may be terminated.” Make this part of the formal lifecycle letter.

- **Route A: Incentivized in-policy upgrade.**  
  - Offer a **discounted uplift** (e.g., 20–30% below the new reference price) if the client upgrades by a given date.  
  - Allow spreading upgrade-related license uplift over **2–3 years** to keep annual spend under tender thresholds.

- **Route B: Legacy penalty pricing.**  
  - If the client refuses, **raise SLA/support fees materially** (e.g., 40–60% over 2–3 years) for the legacy version.  
  - Communicate that this reflects the genuine extra cost and risk of supporting out-of-policy software, not punitive pricing.

- **Route C: Formal decommission notice.**  
  - For the most underpriced, hard-to-support instances (e.g., some of the 15+ year-old version 7 branch solutions  ), give a **multi-year decommission horizon** (e.g., 3 years).  
  - This sets up a predictable future tender: “After 30 Sept 2028, v7 will no longer be supported.”

This approach creates **time-bound “upgrade now or pay more”** decisions that encourage pre‑tender upgrades, but positions Sybrin credibly if a tender is inevitable.

---

### 3.4 Archetype 3 – Forced re-buy with tender: “Full new-sale economics”

Once a bank is tendering, Sybrin should **stop thinking in legacy terms** and price like a new vendor.

Recommended stance:

- **Price at or near market, not at old contract levels.**  
  Anchor Smart Teller and Payments modules against comparable enterprise software (e.g., teller/branch solutions from FIS, Temenos Infinity, or back-office imaging suites from major vendors). These are typically priced on a **per-branch, per-seat, or per-transaction basis**, often with multi‑year minimums; Sybrin should be in a comparable range, tempered by local purchasing power.  
  - For context, tier‑1 teller/branch platforms globally often represent **high six- to low seven-figure USD TCV** for larger banks over a 5‑year term, but in African markets per‑branch or per-seat pricing is adjusted downward. Sybrin’s local presence and 33‑year track record are differentiators here  .

- **Use modular pricing and offer “good/better/best” bundles.**  
  - **Good:** Core teller + essential imaging, at a competitive price to local niche players.  
  - **Better:** Add workflow, branch ops analytics, or integration accelerators.  
  - **Best:** Full stack including Payments connectors (EFT, instant payments, EPO/e-check pipelines) plus SLA upgrades and regulatory reporting.

- **Optionally offer a “loyalty credit,” but only where strategically necessary.**  
  For strategically important incumbents (e.g., anchor logos, pan-African groups), you can offer a **migration credit** (e.g., equal to 1 year of their current maintenance) against first-year fees, to soften optics that they are “buying again what they already own.” This should be a **recorded discount**, not a lower list price; buyers will care about showing a strong list-price framework even if actual NR is lower.

- **Ensure SLA and implementation are fully costed.**  
  Past discounting of projects led to a 30m ZAR annual loss in the project division  . In tenders, resist underpricing services; instead, reduce scope (e.g., use prebuilt integrations, out-of-the-box configurations) to control cost and price.

- **Leverage risk, reliability, and group capabilities in value narrative.**  
  Use the 99.9% uptime track record and pan-African presence as non-price differentiators  . Tender scoring often allocates points to risk and track record — use that to justify a **mid-market price**, not a bottom-feeder one.

---

### 3.5 Archetype 4 – New sales & new products: “Design away from future tender traps”

For new Smart Teller / Payments rollouts (especially instant payments and EPO):

- **Default to subscription / transaction-based pricing.**  
  Align with the Philippines SaaS approach (low capex, pay per transaction/user)  . This reduces capex spikes that drive tenders and creates stickier annuity revenue.

- **Contractualize lifecycle and upgrades as part of subscription.**  
  Include the right to deploy minor and major version upgrades *within the subscription fee* for a defined period (e.g., 5 years), in exchange for a slightly higher annual charge. That way, banks don’t need a new tender for “standard” upgrades.

- **Apply explicit “upgrade resetting” clauses.**  
  Ensure new contracts state that **after a defined period** (e.g., 7–10 years), the bank must re-evaluate or re-contract on current pricing models. This prevents another generation of 15‑year underpriced contracts.

## 4. Specific Tactics to Mitigate Tender Risk While Repricing

Because your question emphasizes that clients may be forced into tenders when required to re-buy, pricing should be combined with **procurement-aware tactics**:

1. **Stagger price increases before the big upgrade.**  
   Implement modest but steady maintenance uplifts (you have already started a first 15% cycle and plan a second  ). By the time a major upgrade is needed, the gap between old and new pricing is smaller, reducing the “shock” that triggers political resistance and aggressive tenders.

2. **Decouple “technical upgrade” from “functional expansion.”**  
   Offer a *bare minimum* “like-for-like” upgrade path with modest uplift (less likely to trigger tender), and sell new modules separately as optional purchases. If procurement insists on tendering new functionality, at least you have preserved the base.

3. **Introduce “upgrade credits” tied to multi-year commitments.**  
   For key clients, you can say: “Commit to 5 years at new rate X, and we’ll waive the one-time upgrade license fee.” This keeps spend within opex bands and can avoid capex thresholds that trigger formal tenders.

4. **Align upgrade timing with regulatory or security drivers.**  
   where regulation or security findings make the upgrade non-negotiable (e.g., central bank guidance on fraud, security scans failing on old frameworks), procurement is more likely to accept **single-source justifications**.

5. **Prepare tender-ready commercial templates now.**  
   Assume that some tenders are inevitable (especially for formally decommissioned Smart Teller versions). Prepare standardized **RFP response pricing grids, bundles, and discount bands** so that commercial decisions are fast and consistent, which matters in the exit narrative.

---

## 5. How to Set the Actual Numbers (Without Overfitting)

Sybrin will need to tailor numbers per market, but the *structure* can be consistent:

- **Reference price list:**  
  Create a **global list price** for Smart Teller and Payments modules by bank size (e.g., tiers based on number of branches or transaction volumes). Use this for new deals and tenders; treat legacy clients as discounted off this list, not as special-cased starting points.

- **Discount bands by archetype:**  
  For each archetype (in-life, breach-but-cooperative, tender, greenfield), define **target discount ranges** (e.g., 40–60% off list for deeply underpriced legacy upgrades that you want to keep; 20–30% off list in tenders; 0–20% off for greenfield deals where you are differentiated).

- **Target uplift for legacy branch/Smart Teller base:**  
  For the 33 branch/Smart Teller clients generating ZAR 10m p.a., define a **3–5-year roadmap** to reach at least **3–5x current revenue**, not 10x, before exit. Going all the way to true “market price” (possibly 10x) risks too much churn in the 18‑month window; 3–5x uplift with controlled churn is both realistic and attractive to buyers  .

- **Project pricing sanity:**  
  Maintain fully loaded, profitable professional services pricing. If a client balks at implementation fees, consider **scope reductions, preconfigured templates, or phased rollout**, not rate cuts. The historical 30m ZAR loss in projects is a clear warning  .

---

## 6. How This Aligns With Exit Story and Long-Term Strategy

- **Supports the “shift to product-led, annuity-heavy” narrative.**  
  Lifecycle-based upgrade pricing, modular subscriptions, and transaction-based models demonstrate that Sybrin has structurally shifted away from one-off services toward recurring software revenue, which is what acquirers value  .

- **Reduces technical debt and support cost narrative.**  
  By pushing legacy clients onto modern Smart Teller and Payments platforms under a clear lifecycle policy, Sybrin can credibly show declining support complexity and costs, which boosts margins and justifies price increases.

- **Creates optionality for new owners.**
  A clean price architecture with standard archetypes, reference lists, and lifecycle clauses gives the acquirer room to tighten discounts, expand transaction-based pricing, or push more aggressively into SaaS post‑deal.
