# 6. Sales Execution & Outreach

## Question
Which channels, events, or media are most effective to position Sybrin as a compliance-first thought leader, given limited LinkedIn usage in some markets?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
LinkedIn should remain Sybrin’s “global backbone” for thought leadership, but in many African and Philippine markets it cannot be the *primary* channel. To position Sybrin as a compliance‑first thought leader within 18 months, prioritize: (1) regulator‑ and donor‑linked forums, (2) bank‑specific executive roundtables, (3) niche banking and payments conferences, and (4) high‑credibility earned media (industry publications, webinars, podcasts), then only secondarily amplify via LinkedIn where usage is strong.

## 1. Time Horizon: What Matters Now vs. Later

### 18‑Month Exit View (through Q1 2027)

In the exit window, channels must do two things: create visible proof that Sybrin is the “safe, compliant pair of hands” and generate near‑term pipeline.

Most critical in the next 18 months:

1. **Regulator-anchored platforms, especially around instant payments and fraud.**  
   - Sybrin wins when there is regulatory change: instant payment mandates, fraud risk requirements (e.g., BSP fraud mandates in the Philippines, check decommissioning in Africa).  
   - Being on panels, working groups, and co‑branded webinars with central banks and payment system operators signals “compliance‑first” more credibly than any owned content.

2. **Invite‑only banking CXO roundtables in 4–5 focus countries.**  
   - Your strategy is to go deep in a few countries (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Philippines, and then Ethiopia) rather than broad.  
   - Small, private, regulator‑adjacent discussions with CROs, COOs, and Heads of Payments about fraud, instant payments, and check decommissioning both accelerate sales and generate stories investors will value.

3. **Flagship regional events where compliance and real‑time payments dominate.**  
   - You are competing with both global vendors (Gartner leaders) and small local players. Being seen at the “serious” conferences (Africa payments, real‑time/instant schemes, fraud/risk) reinforces that Sybrin is the safe, enterprise‑grade choice.

4. **High‑authority earned media (industry journals, donor and scheme case studies).**  
   - Prospective acquirers and tier‑1/2 banks trust neutral sources. Articles, case studies and interviews in central‑bank‑adjacent or donor‑backed channels will do more to prove a compliance‑first posture than social media alone.

LinkedIn should be used to **amplify** what happens in these channels (photos, summaries, links to coverage), not to carry the weight of thought leadership by itself.

### Longer‑term View (post‑exit, growth story for new owners)

Post‑exit, once the upgrade program and SaaS models are more mature, you can invest in:

- **Always‑on digital content ecosystems**: regional blogs, newsletters, and a more aggressive LinkedIn + YouTube webinar series to move down‑market (SACCOs, MFIs, tier‑3 banks).  
- **Developer/partner ecosystems**: technical documentation, APIs, and community events for integrators around instant payments, Tazana, and EPO/e‑checks.  
- **Marketplaces and self‑serve content**: especially for digital onboarding and rural/thrift offerings once the Philippines model is proven.

For now, stick to channels that closely align with regulatory change, trust, and revenue in your chosen 4–5 geographies.

## 2. Channel Strategy: Where to Show Up as “Compliance‑First”

Below is a hierarchy of channels, tailored to Sybrin’s context and constrained LinkedIn usage. The focus is “where does a bank risk/compliance decision‑maker go when they are worried about instant payments, fraud, and regulatory change?”

### A. Regulator, Scheme, and Donor‑Linked Forums (Top Priority)

These are your strongest levers because Sybrin’s wins are anchored in regulation and donor funding.

**1. Central bank and instant‑payments‑scheme events**

Look for opportunities where domestic schemes (e.g., iPSO/Pesalink in Kenya, PayShap in South Africa, SADC‑RTGS, PAPS in East/North Africa) and central banks convene banks to discuss:  
- fraud risk on instant payments,  
- real‑time settlement and operational resilience, and  
- migration from cheques to digital instruments.

Why these matter for “compliance‑first”:

- They are explicitly about *regulation, risk, and compliance.*  
- Being on a panel or case‑study slot positions Sybrin as “the people who make the scheme safe and reliable,” which supports your 99.9% uptime story and fraud‑risk narrative.  
- Banks and regulators in your core markets attend these; this shortens sales cycles on instant payments processing, connectors, and Tazana‑style fraud controls.

What to aim for in the next 18 months:

- **Panels and technical workshops** co‑hosted with scheme operators (e.g., “Managing fraud risk in real‑time rails: lessons from Tazana and PayShap/iPSO integrations”).  
- **Closed‑door regulator/bank working sessions** where Sybrin brings real transaction/fraud patterns (anonymised) and proposes control frameworks.  
- **Co‑authored white papers** with schemes or central banks on topics like:
  - best practices for instant payment fraud controls in emerging markets;  
  - migration paths from cheques to compliant electronic payment orders;  
  - lifecycle management and security for mission‑critical payment systems.

2. **Donor and multilateral events (Gates, AFDB, ADB, World Bank, Linux Foundation)**

You already have a strong anchor with Gates through Tazana in the Philippines. Donor‑hosted events are excellent for compliance‑first positioning because they are explicitly concerned with **consumer protection**, **financial integrity**, and **inclusion**.

Where and how to show up:

- **Gates Foundation‑linked convenings** on instant payments, financial inclusion, and fraud (e.g., events around the Mojaloop community that often include Linux Foundation collaborators: https://mojaloop.io).  
- **Regional AFDB and World Bank financial inclusion conferences** that have tracks on payments and consumer protection. Example: AFDB’s Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Facility events (https://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/adfif).  
- **Panels or case studies** on “Using open‑source fraud platforms (Tazana) to protect low‑income customers in real‑time payments.”  

Why this is powerful:

- Donor‑linked platforms are trusted and neutral, which is crucial when you are not on the Gartner quadrant.  
- They reinforce your narrative that Sybrin can deliver *safe*, *compliant* infrastructure for vulnerable segments (rural/thrift banks, MFIs, SACCOs) without heavy consulting.  
- They support the NPO strategy and exit story: “we have a repeatable model to deploy compliant fraud/risk controls into under‑served markets via donor funding.”

### B. Small, High‑Credibility Executive Roundtables (Country‑Level)

Because your strategy is depth in 4–5 markets, small, curated in‑country roundtables are arguably more effective than broad digital campaigns.

In each key market (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Philippines; Ethiopia once you’re in), aim for:

1. **Quarterly “Compliance & Instant Payments” roundtables**  
   - 10–15 invite‑only participants: CRO, Head of Compliance, Head of Payments, Head of Digital, plus possibly one regulator or scheme representative.  
   - Format:  
     - One external keynote (e.g., scheme operator or donor rep).  
     - A Sybrin‑led case study (e.g., how a Kenyan/Zambian bank manages cheque decommissioning risk or PayShap fraud).  
     - Facilitated Chatham House rule discussion on what is keeping them awake at night.

2. **Thematic deep dives aligned to your portfolio**  
   Examples:
   - “Operational continuity and SLA governance in real‑time payments” (linking to your 99.9% uptime track record).  
   - “Migrating from cheques to compliant electronic payment orders without breaking credit and collections workflows.”  
   - “Implementing open‑source fraud controls (Tazana) in resource‑constrained banks.”

Why these are effective:

- They fit your **relationship‑led, local presence** advantage: clients already expect to see “the Kenyans” or other local staff, not only South Africans.  
- They generate specific follow‑ups for upgrades, new modules, and instant payment connectors in each market.  
- They create *quotable content* for later (e.g., anonymised insights turned into whitepapers, blog posts, or webinars).

### C. Niche Banking, Payments, and Fraud Conferences

Unlike broad fintech events, you want conferences where compliance, risk, and infrastructure are central—not just “innovation.”

Target patterns:

1. **Africa‑focused banking tech & payments conferences**  
   Look for events with tracks on:
   - instant / real‑time payments infrastructure,  
   - fraud, AML, and operational risk,  
   - digital onboarding / KYC for underbanked segments.

Examples to explore (always verify current editions and relevance):

- **Seamless Africa** (by Terrapinn) has strong payments and banking tracks and attracts banks and regulators across East and Southern Africa: https://www.terrapinn.com/exhibition/seamless-africa.  
- **Retail Banking Africa** and similar banking conferences that include payments, risk, and compliance sessions (check the Banking Association South Africa and East Africa banking associations schedules).  
- **Africa Fintech Festival** and regional offshoots sometimes carry infrastructure and regulatory tracks; look for sessions you can tailor to cheques, instant payments, and fraud.  

2. **Philippines and ASEAN banking/risk conferences**  
   Because your Philippines strategy targets rural/thrift banks and is anchored in fraud on instant payments, look at:
   - Bankers Institute of the Philippines events (https://bap.org.ph often co‑hosts with the central bank, BSP).  
   - **BSP‑aligned conferences** on cybersecurity/fraud and digital payments, where you can present Tazana implementations as a case study.  
   - **Asian Banker** conferences, which regularly host risk and compliance forums in the region: https://www.theasianbanker.com (search for risk, compliance, and digital payments events).

What to do at these events:

- Prioritize **speaking roles, not just sponsorship**. Your value is thought leadership on compliance, not brand logos.  
- Offer **joint presentations** with banks, schemes, or donors whenever possible. A bank’s CRO explaining how they achieved fraud control with Sybrin is more credible than Sybrin alone.  
- Design sessions with explicit compliance themes, e.g.:
  - “Designing compliant real‑time payment rails: lessons from Africa and Southeast Asia.”  
  - “From paper cheques to electronic payment orders: regulatory and operational considerations.”

## 3. Media & Content: How to Communicate Compliance‑First

Because LinkedIn is unevenly adopted, focus on *earned* and *partner* channels that target bankers and regulators directly.

### A. Industry Publications and Trusted Media

1. **Pan‑African banking and risk publications**

Aim for articles, interviews, and op‑eds in outlets that senior bankers and regulators read, such as:

- **Banker Africa / African Banker magazine** (https://africanbankeronline.com).  
- **Finextra** and **The Paypers** for global payments and transaction banking coverage that often feature African case studies: https://www.finextra.com, https://thepaypers.com.  
- Regional outlets like **CIO Africa** and **ITWeb** for technology angles (e.g., upgrade program, 99.9% uptime): https://www.cioafrica.co.ke, https://www.itweb.co.za.

Suggested story angles:

- “Managing compliance and operational risk in the shift to real‑time payments in African markets.”  
- “What cheque decommissioning really means for bank compliance, and how to protect key use cases with electronic payment orders.”  
- “Lessons from implementing open‑source fraud controls in emerging markets: the Tazana experience.”

2. **Philippines and ASEAN media**

For your rural/thrift and donor story:

- **BusinessWorld**, **The Philippine Star**, and **Inquirer Business** often run banking and fintech stories; pitch pieces that highlight fraud controls and inclusion.  
- **The Asian Banker** for more technical/industry‑specific content.  

Angles:

- “How rural and thrift banks can meet BSP fraud requirements for real‑time payments.”  
- “Using donor‑funded, open‑source tools to protect low‑income customers from digital fraud.”

### B. Webinars and Podcasts

Because your buyers often prefer live discussion over blogs, webinars and podcasts can substitute for LinkedIn in markets where it is weak.

1. **Co‑branded webinars with schemes, donors, or banking associations**

- Host co‑branded sessions with a payment scheme (e.g., Pesalink’s iPSO), a central bank department, a bankers’ association, or Gates/AFDB teams.  
- Topics should be explicitly compliance‑oriented:
  - “Fraud risk management framework for instant payments in [country].”  
  - “How to upgrade legacy payments systems without falling foul of new security standards.”

2. **Targeted risk/compliance podcasts**

- Offer your CEO/CTO/Head of Risk as guests on niche podcasts that focus on banking transformation, risk, and regulation—e.g., shows covered by The Asian Banker or regional industry bodies.  
- Use them to tell concrete stories (e.g., a bank avoiding a fraud incident due to Tazana).

These digital formats are accessible regardless of local social media habits and can later be cut into snippets for whichever channels *are* used locally (WhatsApp, email newsletters, internal bank portals).

### C. Email & Association Channels

In many African markets, **WhatsApp, email, and association newsletters** are more influential than LinkedIn.

- Work with **banking associations** (Kenya Bankers Association, Zambia Institute of Banking and Financial Services, Ghana Association of Bankers etc.) to:
  - circulate short compliance briefs,  
  - invite members to your roundtables and webinars,  
  - distribute case studies and whitepapers.  
- Use **short, practical, compliance‑focused briefs** (2–3 pages) that association secretariats are happy to circulate.

## 4. How LinkedIn Fits Despite Limited Usage

Even with limited usage in some markets, LinkedIn remains strategically important as:

1. **An “investor and global buyer proof‑point.”**  
   - Potential acquirers and multinational banks will check Sybrin’s digital footprint. A steady drumbeat of compliance‑oriented posts, article links, and event recaps reinforces the exit story.

2. **A central repository of your thought leadership.**  
   - Every regulator‑ or donor‑linked event should produce:
     - a short LinkedIn post from the corporate account,  
     - posts from key executives (CEO, CTO, regional heads), and  
     - links to any published whitepapers or media coverage.

3. **A bridge across markets.**  
   - Even if local bankers don’t live on LinkedIn, partners, donors, and global banks do.  
   - Use LinkedIn to cross‑pollinate: share Philippines fraud lessons with African markets and vice versa, to show global perspective on compliance.

To keep effort proportionate:

- Focus on **quality over frequency**: 2–3 meaningful posts per month per region, tied to concrete events or publications.  
- Use content already created for higher‑impact channels (events, whitepapers, media), not net‑new “for LinkedIn” content.

---

## 5. Putting It Together: A Practical 12–18 Month Channel Plan

Anchored to your exit timeline and current strategy, a pragmatic approach could look like this:

1. **Every quarter in each focus country** (Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana, Philippines):  
   - One in‑person or virtual **executive roundtable** on a compliance theme (instant payments, cheque decommissioning, fraud).  
   - One **co‑branded webinar** with a scheme, bank, donor, or association.

2. **Twice a year regionally (Africa + ASEAN):**  
   - Speak at at least one **major payments/risk conference** in Africa and one in ASEAN, with a compliance‑heavy topic.  
   - Aim for at least one **regulator‑ or donor‑co‑presented case study** annually.

3. **Continuous earned media / publications (target 4–6 pieces per year):**  
   - 2–3 articles focused on instant payments and fraud risk in African markets.  
   - 1–2 pieces on the Philippines Tazana experience and rural/thrift compliance.  
   - 1 piece on cheque decommissioning and EPO/e‑check design from a compliance and legal standpoint.

4. **LinkedIn and digital amplification (light but consistent):**  
   - Every event, publication, or donor success → one or more short posts.  
   - Quarterly summary posts from leadership highlighting “what we’ve learned about compliance and risk in real‑time payments this quarter.”

This mix plays to Sybrin’s demonstrated strengths—regulation‑aligned timing, local presence, reliability, and donor partnerships—while avoiding over‑reliance on LinkedIn in markets where it is weak, and it builds the “compliance‑first thought leader” story that both banks and potential acquirers will value within the 18‑month exit window.
