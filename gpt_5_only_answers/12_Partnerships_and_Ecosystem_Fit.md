# 4. Partnerships & Ecosystem Fit

## Question
Which 2–3 strategic partners would be most critical to widen reach and strengthen positioning?

---

## Answer

**In a nutshell:**  
The 2–3 most critical strategic partners for Sybrin to widen reach and strengthen positioning are:  
1) **Tier‑1 core banking / cloud‑core platforms (e.g., Temenos, Thought Machine)**;  
2) **Pan‑African banking groups (e.g., Ecobank, Access Bank, Standard Bank/Stanbic) as “anchor clients–cum–distribution partners”**;  
3) **Global donors / ecosystem stewards around Tazana and instant payments (e.g., Gates Foundation + Linux Foundation / Mojaloop community).**  

These three partner types directly amplify sales, credibility, and product relevance within the 18‑month exit window while laying down structural growth rails for the buyer post‑exit.

## 1. Time Horizon Lens

### 18‑Month Exit View (to Q1 2027)

In the pre‑exit window, partners must do three things: shorten sales cycles, expand addressable market with minimal new cost, and strengthen Sybrin’s perceived “strategic asset” status.

- **Core/cloud‑core vendor partnerships**:
  - Make it easier for banks already standardised on Temenos/Finastra/Thought Machine to choose Sybrin for payments, onboarding, and branch solutions, because Sybrin is the “pre‑integrated, trusted” option around the core.  
  - Directly supports rapid revenue capture in East Africa, Ghana, and future Ethiopia, where integration risk and complexity are major buying barriers.
- **Pan‑African banking groups**:
  - A single group‑level deal (like ABSA RoA historically) can open 5–10+ countries in one stroke, exactly the kind of efficient scale story buyers pay a premium for.  
  - With upgrade program and new products (C2B, instant payments, eventual e‑checks/EPO) ready, using group partnerships to cross‑sell into multiple geographies is a very tangible growth narrative.
- **Donor / Tazana ecosystem partners**:
  - Gates is already funding Tazana implementations in the Philippines and using Sybrin as implementer.  
  - Deepening and formalising this into a repeatable model (Gates + Linux Foundation/Mojaloop, potentially Mastercard Foundation or African Development Bank for Africa) creates visible, contracted future pipeline in inclusion and fraud‑for‑instant‑payments – highly attractive to strategic buyers.

These three partner types can produce evidence of: “We are already plugged into the key rails (cores and rails vendors), large buyers (banking groups), and new funding pools (donors). If you buy us, you’re buying access to those ecosystems.”

### Longer‑Term View (post‑exit)

After the exit, the eventual owner can choose how aggressively to expand. The same three partner types provide long‑run optionality:

- **Core/cloud‑core vendors** support:
  - Regional and eventually global expansion without carrying a heavy direct‑sales cost in every geography.
  - A more standardized product roadmap and cleaner integration story, reducing bespoke work that has historically hurt margins.
- **Pan‑African groups** enable:
  - Structural embedding of Sybrin’s stack into the operating backbone of regional banks, making Sybrin very hard to displace and opening the door to transaction‑based and SaaS revenues at scale.
- **Donor / ecosystem players** enable:
  - Expansion into underserved segments (MFIs, SACCOs, tier‑3 banks) via funded deployments, with the Philippines model as template.
  - Entry into new regions (other parts of Southeast Asia, new African markets) with lower commercial risk.

## 2. Partner Type 1 – Core Banking / Cloud‑Core Platforms

Sybrin already **“plays around the periphery”** of core banking and integrates with Temenos, Finastra, IBM and newer cloud cores such as Thought Machine. This is not competition; it is the natural backbone for Sybrin’s products.

### Why this partner type is critical

In practice, many large and mid‑tier banks start from the question: *“What’s proven and certified with our core stack?”* If Sybrin is tightly partnered and pre‑certified with leading core providers, that:

- **Reduces perceived integration risk and delivery time.**  
  Integration complexity is one of the main reasons deals are slow and banks are reluctant to switch from incumbents. A “certified connector” or pre‑built accelerator can materially shorten sales and implementation cycles.

- **Improves competitive posture vs. niche 5–6‑person local players.**  
  When a local competitor is cheaper on features, Sybrin’s edge must be: reliability (99.9% uptime), scale, and risk comfort. Being the endorsed or preferred partner around a core used by that bank strengthens the “no‑one gets fired for choosing this” argument, similar to the Gartner effect at the top end.

- **Supports key products in the pipeline.**  
  - **Instant payments processing and domestic scheme connectors** (PayShap, iPSO/Pesalink, PAPS, SADC‑RTGS) become significantly more compelling if they are “the instant payment layer for Temenos/Thought Machine banks in Africa.”  
  - **EPO/e‑checks** as a national or scheme‑level play will still need tight integration to core systems; having the core vendors as allies rather than neutral parties will ease scheme adoption.

### Who, concretely?

1. **Temenos** – dominant across African Tier‑1 and Tier‑2 banks.  
   - Strong African installed base and existing Sybrin integration experience.  
   - Deepening into a formal, marketed partnership with joint reference architectures and go‑to‑market for: cheque modernization/EPO, instant EFT, C2B, branch network v2, and digital onboarding.

2. **Thought Machine (and similar cloud‑native cores)** – future‑proof and acquisition‑friendly.  
   - Thought Machine is pushing cloud‑native cores into emerging markets and partner ecosystems.  
   - Being one of their preferred partners for payments, onboarding and fraud tooling gives Sybrin relevance in modern, cloud‑first transformations and digital bank launches.

3. (Optionally) **Finastra / IBM core** – where Sybrin already has deep experience.  
   - Less about adding a new relationship, more about formalising and packaging it as “pre‑integrated solutions” to cut down sales objections and implementation risk.

### 18‑month emphasis

- **Focus on 1–2 global core partners and go deep rather than wide.**  
  Build a crisp, co‑branded proposition: “If you are a Temenos or Thought Machine bank in East or Southern Africa, Sybrin is the fastest, safest route to modern payments, branch and onboarding.”  
- Use these partnerships tactically to:
  - Accelerate deals in **Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania, Ghana** where those cores are prevalent.  
  - Underpin the **Ethiopia entry** strategy by offering regulators and banks a “known‑good” integration story.

## 3. Partner Type 2 – Pan‑African Banking Groups as Strategic Anchors

Group‑level banks are both customers and, effectively, distribution channels. Sybrin’s success with ABSA Rest of Africa shows the model: one group deal → presence in several countries.

### Why this partner type is critical

- **Multi‑country revenue leverage.**  
  A single group partnership can drive simultaneous or staged rollouts across 5–20 countries, which is far more efficient than winning one bank in one country at a time – especially within an 18‑month valuation window.

- **Defensive moat vs. being displaced during consolidations.**  
  Bank acquisitions are a threat: when a Sybrin customer is bought by a group that prefers another vendor, Sybrin risks losing the business. By aligning at **group level**, Sybrin becomes the *standard* rather than the exception.

- **Ideal context for cross‑selling existing portfolio.**  
  Group banks usually have:
  - Cheque and EFT flows → check truncation and future EPO opportunity.  
  - Corporate business → C2B and branch network needs.  
  - Consumer onboarding + fraud needs → digital onboarding and Tazana‑style fraud tooling.  
  Group‑level committees are receptive to coordinated, multi‑product rollouts that harmonise processes and tech across subsidiaries.

### Which groups matter most?

Given Sybrin’s footprint and strategic priorities, three stand out:

1. **Ecobank Group**  
   - Presence in ~20 African countries; Sybrin already serves 1–2 entities.  
   - Upgrading that to a **group‑wide framework agreement** could unlock multiple West and Central African markets without chasing “Francophone North‑West Africa” as stand‑alone entries (which Sybrin is deliberately avoiding) – implementation can be focused on selected countries where Ecobank is strong and conditions (regulation, bank profitability) are good.

2. **Access Bank Group**  
   - Although Nigeria itself is off the table, Access is acquiring banks across Africa.  
   - Positioning Sybrin as the **preferred partner for acquired entities outside Nigeria** would turn a displacement risk into a growth channel, particularly in countries where Sybrin is already present (e.g., Zambia, Ghana, East Africa).

3. **Standard Bank / Stanbic**  
   - Large footprint in Southern and East Africa with sophisticated central architecture teams.  
   - A group‑level partnership would reinforce Sybrin’s strengths in **Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia** and potentially open doors in markets where Sybrin currently has minimal presence but strong product–market fit (e.g., Ghana).

ABSA RoA is already a success story; the priority now is to replicate that pattern with 1–2 additional groups.

### 18‑month emphasis

- **Select 1–2 target groups for a structured, executive‑level campaign.**  
  Build a clear group‑level pitch: “We already run your payments / onboarding in Country X with 99.9% uptime; here is what a group‑wide standardisation on Sybrin would deliver in cost, risk, and time‑to‑market.”
- Tie the pitch directly to **regulatory and portfolio themes**:
  - Instant payments and fraud controls (where central banks are tightening rules).  
  - Branch network modernisation and cheque decommissioning/EPO in specific countries (Kenya, Zambia, Malawi).  
  - Corporate banking digitisation (C2B + branch network v2).

This allows Sybrin to show buyers, by the time of exit, that it has **at least one more ABSA‑style group platform** underway or signed, with visible multi‑year rollout value.

## 4. Partner Type 3 – Donor / Ecosystem Stewards Around Tazana & Instant Payments

The Philippines strategy is already anchored in **Gates‑funded Tazana** deployments across 10 banks, with Sybrin as the implementer. This is more than a one‑off project; it is the template for a repeatable model that blends donor funding, inclusion goals, and Sybrin’s products.

### Why this partner type is critical

- **Unlocks segments Sybrin currently doesn’t serve commercially.**  
  MFIs, SACCOs, rural and thrift banks cannot afford traditional African pricing. Donor‑backed models allow Sybrin to:
  - Deploy digital onboarding and fraud tools at scale in the Philippines and, later, Africa.  
  - Refine a low‑touch SaaS model that can be reimported into Africa for small institutions once proven.

- **Creates a “mission‑plus‑margin” growth story** attractive to both strategic and financial buyers.  
  Buyers increasingly value assets with:
  - Exposure to high‑growth themes like instant payments and financial inclusion.  
  - Access to non‑traditional capital pools (grants and blended finance).

- **Ties into global open‑source / instant payment ecosystems.**  
  Gates is involved in multiple initiatives (e.g., Mojaloop via the Mojaloop Foundation / Linux Foundation). Being an implementer and solutions partner in that ecosystem:
  - Positions Sybrin as a go‑to implementation partner for **fraud‑for‑instant‑payments** in emerging markets.  
  - Creates line‑of‑sight to other donors such as **Mastercard Foundation**, **African Development Bank**, and **World Bank** for African projects.

### Concretely, which partnerships to deepen?

1. **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)** – anchor donor.  
   - Solidify Sybrin’s role not just as the Philippines implementer but as a **preferred partner for Tazana/instant‑payment fraud deployments in other regions** where Gates is active.  
   - Co‑create a medium‑term roadmap: e.g., “after Philippines, we will jointly explore X African markets where instant payment regulation is tightening and small institutions need low‑cost fraud tooling.”

2. **Linux Foundation / Mojaloop Foundation and associated open‑payment ecosystems**  
   - Mojaloop, an open‑source instant payments platform originally spearheaded by Gates, is increasingly deployed in emerging markets. Partnerships here:
     - Align perfectly with Sybrin’s product focus on **instant payments processing**, **connectors**, and **fraud controls**.  
     - Offer an additional layer of legitimacy and community support around Sybrin’s implementation and tooling work.

3. **Regional development finance institutions (DFIs)** – **African Development Bank, possibly Mastercard Foundation** for African inclusion plays.  
   - Once the Philippines proof‑point and NPO structure are in place, DFIs can fund:
     - Roll‑out of Tazana‑style fraud systems and digital onboarding in African SACCOs, MFIs, and smaller banks.  
     - Projects aligned with national instant payment schemes and financial inclusion strategies.

### 18‑month emphasis

- **Exploit the Philippines project to its full signalling value.**  
  Demonstrate successful delivery for the first 10 Gates‑funded banks and convert that into:
  - Public case studies and thought‑leadership on instant‑payment fraud and small‑bank onboarding.  
  - A written, multi‑year collaboration framework with Gates on “where next”.

- **Formalise Sybrin’s role in the broader instant‑payments ecosystem (e.g., Mojaloop community).**  
  Even modest technical and community involvement can signal strongly to prospective buyers that Sybrin is plugged into the global movement shaping how instant payments and fraud controls are built in emerging markets.

- **Align NPO design with these partners.**  
  Ensure that the NPO structures Sybrin sets up are explicitly compatible with Gates/DFI funding rules so that the buyer sees a **clear, ready‑to‑scale pipeline** of funded inclusion projects, not just a theoretical concept.

## 5. Why These 2–3 Partner Types Beat Other Options

Other potential partner categories (local resellers, small system integrators, generic consulting firms, or broad marketing partners) might help tactically, but they do not move the valuation needle within 18 months as strongly as:

- **Core/cloud‑core vendors** – which attack the fundamental “integration risk” barrier and institutionalise Sybrin in the bank tech stack.
- **Pan‑African groups** – which convert Sybrin’s existing strengths (reliability, branch/payment footprint, upgrade program) into multi‑country annuity streams.
- **Donor / ecosystem stewards around Tazana and instant payments** – which open up new segments, geographies, and funding pools, and show a compelling inclusion‑plus‑growth narrative.

Together, these three partner types maximise **reach** (new markets, more banks per deal) and **positioning** (trusted around the core, standard in regional groups, and central to the financial‑inclusion/instant‑payments story), both in the immediate run‑up to exit and for the long‑term trajectory a new owner will care about.
