# 7. Geography-Specific Strategy

## Question
South Africa: Is there any realistic payments market opportunity, or is it too saturated and better to double down on Africa/Philippines?

---

## Answer

## In a nutshell

There is a **real, time‑bound payments opportunity in South Africa** – especially around PayShap/NPU connectivity, real‑time payment hubs, and fraud/AML – and the market is **not saturated from an infrastructure point of view**. But it is also **crowded and expensive to win**, so the rational move for Sybrin is to **pursue a narrow, high‑impact SA payments wedge (PayShap/NPU + fraud/KYC) while doubling down on higher‑ROI growth plays in the rest of Africa and the Philippines**.

---

## 1. Time‑horizon view for Sybrin

### 18‑month exit view (to ~Q1 2027)

For the exit window, South Africa should be treated as:

- **A credibility and valuation booster, not the primary growth engine.**  
  SA banking IT spend is very large (TAM R66–214B / $3.8–12.3B annually, with R12–42.5B SAM in the segments Sybrin targets). Having visible traction in this market strengthens the “quality of earnings” and growth story for buyers, even if most new ARR actually comes from East/West Africa and the Philippines.
- **A focused payments play around regulatory programmes now in flight (2025–2027).**  
  The SARB Payments Ecosystem Modernisation (PEM) programme and PayShap / National Payments Utility (NPU) transformation are peaking exactly in the exit window, creating a unique entry point that likely will not repeat in the same form later.
- **An opportunity to show “we can win at home” in next‑gen payments.**  
  Buyers will discount a story if Sybrin wins instant‑payments deals in Ghana or Mozambique but is absent from its home market’s flagship faster‑payments programme.

In practice, that means:

- Select **1–2 anchor SA payments wins** (ideally BankservAfrica/PayInc plus one Tier‑1 or digital bank) in instant payments + fraud/KYC, and avoid getting sucked into broad, slow, consulting‑heavy SA pursuits.
- Keep SA investment modest and tightly scoped: **business‑development and solutioning capacity**, not a large build‑out.

### Longer‑term view (post‑exit)

Longer term, the SA payments market is attractive but structurally different from the rest of Africa:

- **High budgets and sophistication, but intense global competition.**  
  Tier‑1 SA banks each run multi‑billion‑rand IT budgets, and are deep into cloud, ISO 20022, and instant payments modernisation. However, they already work with global leaders (FIS, Fiserv, ACI, Temenos, Oracle) and regional heavyweights; SA is one of the most contested fintech markets on the continent.
- **More build‑vs‑buy, and more in‑house capability.**  
  SA banks frequently build orchestration, UX, and some fraud/compliance capabilities themselves, or embed them into large platform deals, so the “pure white space” is smaller than in many African markets.
- **Best used as a flagship reference market.**  
  Over a 3–5‑year horizon, a small set of **lighthouse SA payments and fraud deployments** can be leveraged heavily to win in other African countries (“if it runs at Capitec / Standard Bank / Bankserv, it can run anywhere”).

So from a strategic‑fit perspective, SA is **worth cultivating as a reference and high‑margin niche**, but the bulk of growth (especially for new products like instant payments and fraud, and for SaaS models) should be sought in:

- Under‑served African markets with regulatory urgency (Ghana, Zambia, Kenya, Malawi, Ethiopia).
- The Philippines (rural/thrift segment, Gates‑funded Tazana roll‑out) where Sybrin can shape a segment from the ground up rather than displacing mature incumbents.

## 2. Is SA “too saturated” in payments?

It depends **which layer of “payments”** you mean. The market is crowded in some layers, but far from saturated in others that match Sybrin’s strengths.

### 2.1 Consumer‑facing / merchant payments: crowded and hard to win

At the **front‑end (wallets, merchant acquiring, payment gateways, neo‑banks)**:

- There is strong competition from **PSPs and gateways** (e.g., DPO PayGate regionally) and large bank‑led apps. These players are deeply integrated into the SA retail and e‑commerce ecosystem, making displacement costly and slow.
- Digital KYC/onboarding is crowded: Smile ID, Sumsub, Uqudo, Jumio/Onfido and others already have meaningful share, with strong backing (e.g., Smile ID + Mastercard partnership in 2025).
- Banks are comfortable engaging multiple vendors for fraud and identity, and often negotiate very hard on price.

For Sybrin, trying to win big in **consumer‑facing payments or generic KYC in SA** would mean:

- Competing against well‑funded global players at **single‑digit market share starting point**.
- Long, expensive sales cycles for moderate margin.

**Conclusion:** this layer is effectively “saturated” from Sybrin’s perspective and should *not* be a focus in the 18‑month window.

### 2.2 Core payment rails, instant payments, and NPU: under‑penetrated, time‑sensitive

At the **infrastructure layer (rails, switch connectors, real‑time hubs, systemic fraud)**, the picture is very different and much more attractive for Sybrin.

Key dynamics:

- **PayShap and the PEM programme are still early.**  
  PayShap went live in March 2023 with an initial set of banks; adoption has been slower than expected, with <1M monthly transactions despite millions of registered ShapIDs. SARB’s PEM programme is explicitly focused on fixing adoption barriers and extending capabilities, and continues through 2025–2027.
- **NPU (National Payments Utility) transformation is mid‑flight.**  
  SARB is acquiring 50% of BankservAfrica (rebranding to PayInc) and turning it into an NPU with broader participation from non‑bank providers. This overhaul changes governance, participation rules, and technical architecture – which typically opens **new vendor selection windows**.
- **Jobs‑to‑be‑done match Sybrin’s sweet spots.**  
  Tier‑1 banks and PayInc have urgent jobs around:
  - Achieving compliant, high‑volume real‑time payments (PayShap/NPU + ISO 20022) with 99.9%+ uptime.
  - Growing PayShap volumes by 3–5x while keeping operational complexity manageable.
  - Rolling out better fraud detection for instant payments, as SA faces multi‑billion‑rand fraud losses and regulators tighten expectations.
- **Sybrin is already architected for exactly this:**
  - Real‑time payments infrastructure, payment hubs, and switch managers that support ISO 20022 and instant clearing.
  - Tazana as an open‑source fraud engine, which can be pitched at a **network level** (NPU or bank consortia) rather than one‑bank‑at‑a‑time.

The internal research classifies the **BankservAfrica/PayInc + NPU opportunity as “VERY HIGH” fit and “CRITICAL” timing for 2025–2027**. Similarly, payment processing + switch connectors for PayShap/NPU are rated as **“HIGH demand solutions” for Tier‑1 banks** in the SA Jobs‑To‑Be‑Done analysis.

**Conclusion:** at the infrastructure layer, the SA payments market is **not saturated**; it is in a once‑per‑generation modernisation cycle with structural room for a specialist like Sybrin – if it focuses tightly on PayShap/NPU, real‑time hubs, and fraud.

## 3. How big and realistic is the SA payments opportunity for Sybrin?

### 3.1 Quantitative sense‑check

From the SA market‑entry strategy:

- Total banking IT TAM in SA: **R66–214B annually** ($3.8–12.3B).  
- Sybrin‑addressable SAM (Tier‑2/3 banks, digital banks, MFIs): **R12–42.5B annually** ($690M–2.44B).
- Within that SAM, the **highest‑urgency, highest‑willingness‑to‑pay areas** are:
  - Payment processing + switch connectors for PayShap/NPU.  
  - Fraud/risk management (R1.9B+ fraud problem).  
  - Digital onboarding/KYC/AML driven by FICA enforcement (heavy penalties).

Given Sybrin’s current brand, installed base, and product strengths, a **realistic 3‑year SA payments/fraud revenue target** looks like:

- **Low case:** R30–50M annual recurring revenue (1–2 key infrastructure wins, plus 1–2 bank‑level deployments).  
- **Base case:** R70–120M ARR (1 NPU/PayInc‑type deal plus 3–5 banks across Tier‑1 and digital segments).  
- **High case (requires flawless execution and some luck):** R150M+ ARR, if Sybrin becomes a de facto standard connector/fraud layer in the NPU ecosystem.

Relative to the R12–42.5B SAM, even the high case is a single‑digit share, which is **credible** and not constrained by “saturation”.

### 3.2 Execution friction and trade‑offs

However, there are material costs and risks:

- **Very long and political sales cycles at Tier‑1 and PayInc.**  
  Decision timelines of 12–18+ months are common, with heavy procurement, architecture reviews, and regulatory oversight. That clashes with the 18‑month exit clock.
- **Strong incumbent and global competition.**  
  Global payments vendors, big SIs, and local niche players already have deep relationships; Sybrin needs a sharp, differentiated story (African expertise, 99.9% uptime, instant‑payments focus, open‑source fraud) to justify displacement or incremental spend.
- **Higher compliance bar and certification cost.**  
  POPIA, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and data‑residency requirements are strict and non‑negotiable for SA banks, increasing the non‑product cost of doing business.
- **Opportunity cost vs. less crowded markets.**  
  The same product and sales effort can often deliver **faster and larger relative wins** in Ghana, Zambia, Tanzania, or Ethiopia, where there are fewer global competitors and more white space.

## 4. How to balance SA vs. Africa/Philippines in practice

Given Sybrin’s constraints (18‑month exit, product‑led focus, limited appetite for big speculative bets), the rational portfolio approach is:

### 4.1 What to do in South Africa

1. **Pursue a narrow, high‑leverage instant‑payments strategy:**

   - Make **BankservAfrica/PayInc + NPU** a top‑tier account, positioned around:
     - PayShap / fast‑payments switch connectors and payment hub capabilities.  
     - Network‑level fraud detection using Tazana.  
     - Onboarding/KYC for new non‑bank NPU participants.
   - In parallel, target **2–3 priority banks** where timing is aligned:
     - Tier‑1s with active payments modernisation (Standard Bank, FirstRand, Nedbank, Absa).  
     - Digital‑first players (TymeBank, Capitec, OM Bank) that value time‑to‑market over large‑vendor comfort.
   - Lead with **one core offer**: “Real‑time payment hub + PayShap/NPU connector + fraud/AML”.

2. **Anchor SA positioning in compliance and systemic reliability:**

   - Emphasise 99.9%+ uptime track record in high‑volume African payments.  
   - Package **ISO 20022, POPIA, FICA, and AML** compliance as out‑of‑the‑box capabilities rather than “toolkit” components.

3. **Avoid spreading into lower‑ROI SA battles in the next 18 months:**

   - De‑prioritise general KYC SaaS competition vs. Smile ID, Sumsub, etc.  
   - Avoid commoditised EFT/batch projects unless bundled into a strategic real‑time payments deal.  
   - Only pursue branch digitisation or generic workflow projects when tightly connected to a core payments/fraud sale.

### 4.2 What to prioritize outside South Africa

1. **Double down on Africa where regulation creates “must‑buy” conditions:**

   - **E‑checks / EPO** in markets discussing cheque decommissioning (Kenya, Zambia, Malawi) – low global competition, high Sybrin asset leverage.  
   - Instant payments connectivity and hubs where schemes are launching or scaling (Kenya iPSO, SADC‑RTGS, PAPS) – similar jobs to SA but with fewer incumbents.  
   - Fraud and compliance in markets with fresh crises or donor funding support (e.g., fraud spikes in Ghana, AfDB/World Bank programmes).

2. **Execute Philippines as the flagship SaaS / donor‑funded growth story:**

   - Land the 10 Gates‑funded Tazana implementations and then expand to more rural/thrift banks.  
   - Use this as proof that Sybrin can scale **low‑touch SaaS** and **donor‑funded deployments** – a key part of the growth narrative for buyers.

3. **Use SA wins to strengthen, not dominate, the equity story:**

   - A credible SA instant‑payments/NPU win adds a “quality badge” to the African and Philippine growth story.  
   - But the **numerical growth story** (new ARR, customer count, transaction volumes) should come from less saturated markets.

## 5. Direct answer to the question

- **Is there a realistic payments market opportunity in South Africa?**  
  Yes. At the **infrastructure layer** – PayShap/NPU connectivity, real‑time payment hubs, and instant‑payments fraud/AML – there is a **real and time‑sensitive opportunity** between now and 2027, aligned with SARB’s PEM and NPU programmes and the banks’ own modernization projects.

- **Is the market “too saturated” to be worth it?**  
  Front‑end consumer/merchant payments and generic digital KYC are effectively saturated and should not be Sybrin’s focus in SA. But the **core rails and systemic fraud layer are not saturated**, and Sybrin has a credible wedge there.

- **So what should Sybrin do?**  
  In the 18‑month exit window, **do not try to “win South Africa” broadly**. Instead:
  - **Take a narrow but high‑leverage SA position around instant payments + NPU + fraud**, aiming for 1–2 flagship wins.
  - **Concentrate the bulk of new‑logo and new‑product effort on Africa and the Philippines**, where competition is thinner, donor funding is available, and Sybrin’s installed base and product roadmap (e‑checks, instant payments, Tazana) give it stronger odds of fast, visible growth.

This balance gives you the **valuation upside of an SA presence in next‑gen payments** while still **maximizing near‑term revenue and ARR growth where barriers and saturation are lower**.
