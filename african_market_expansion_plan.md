# Sybrin African Market Expansion Strategy Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a systematic approach to identify and prioritize African countries for Sybrin's market expansion, considering their current presence, strategic constraints, product portfolio, and market opportunities.

## Strategic Context & Constraints

### Current Strategic Decisions (From Transcript):
1. **Geographic Exclusions**: Northwest French-speaking Africa (complexity, language barriers, corruption)
2. **Nigeria Status**: Currently "off the cards" - immediate "no thank you" to opportunities
3. **Ghana Exception**: Still considered viable despite northwest location due to recent developments
4. **Target Reduction**: From 14 countries attempted to 4-5 realistic targets
5. **Resource Reality**: Limited people, budget, and bandwidth
6. **Timeline Pressure**: 18-month exit horizon requiring short-term focus

### Key Business Drivers:
- **Legacy Revenue Risk**: Check decommissioning threatens major revenue stream
- **Upgrade Program**: 150+ legacy systems requiring modernization (24-month timeline)
