## CONCLUSION

Sybrin has strong product-market fit for core banking jobs (compliance, payments, onboarding, fraud) across all geographies. The company is **currently supporting** these jobs well for existing customers.

However, significant opportunities exist in jobs Sybrin **can support** but isn't fully addressing, particularly with Tier 2 banks, MFIs, and digital banks. These segments have jobs that map well to existing products but need targeted positioning and minor enhancements.

The **critical gaps** center around advanced analytics, AI/ML, and specialized models (agent networks, village banking). These gaps are blocking entry to some segments and creating competitive vulnerabilities.

**Strategic Imperative:** Focus on converting "Can Support" jobs to "Currently Supporting" through targeted sales and minor product enhancements, while selectively addressing critical gaps that block major opportunities.

**The Formula for Growth:**
1. Dominate core jobs in existing markets
2. Expand to adjacent jobs with existing products
3. Selectively fill gaps that unlock new segments
4. Enter new markets with proven playbooks

Success requires discipline in saying "no" to jobs that don't align with core capabilities while aggressively pursuing jobs where Sybrin has competitive advantage.
