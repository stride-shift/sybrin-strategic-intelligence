## Conclusion

Understanding customer jobs reveals that different institution types have fundamentally different needs, even when they operate in the same market. Sybrin's opportunity lies not just in addressing functional needs but in helping each segment achieve their higher-level aspirations and manage their unique emotional and social pressures.

The most valuable approach is to:
1. **Segment by job similarity**, not just institution type
2. **Address complete job stacks**, including emotional and social dimensions
3. **Recognize geographic variations** in job priorities
4. **Track job evolution** as institutions mature
5. **Bundle solutions** by job clusters, not product categories

This customer-centric JTBD view should guide go-to-market strategy, product development priorities, and partnership strategies.
