## Conclusion

The competitive landscape reveals a fragmented market with no single vendor dominating across all segments and geographies. Global vendors serve Tier 1 banks well but struggle with affordability and local requirements. Regional players understand local needs but lack comprehensive solutions. Digital platforms excel at greenfield deployments but can't handle complex migrations.

**Sybrin's opportunity lies in:**
1. **Serving the underserved middle** - Tier 2 banks, MFIs, SACCOs
2. **Bridging global and local** - Enterprise capability with African expertise
3. **Enabling ecosystem plays** - Integration and orchestration
4. **Fast-tracking compliance** - Regulatory expertise advantage
5. **Regional expansion platform** - Pan-African standardization

The key is not to compete head-on with global vendors for Tier 1 banks or with digital platforms for greenfield deployments, but to dominate the underserved middle market with tailored, affordable, locally-relevant solutions.
