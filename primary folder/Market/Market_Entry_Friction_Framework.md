## FRICTION INTERACTION EFFECTS

### Amplifying Combinations
Certain frictions reinforce each other:

1. **Regulatory + Political**: Unstable politics leads to unpredictable regulations
2. **Cultural + Partnership**: Relationship-based cultures require strong local partners
3. **Technical + Economic**: Poor infrastructure combined with budget constraints
4. **Competitive + Customer Acquisition**: Strong incumbents increase reference requirements

### Mitigating Combinations
Some factors can reduce friction:

1. **Strong Partners + Cultural**: Good partners navigate cultural complexity
2. **Government Support + Regulatory**: Government backing eases regulatory burden
3. **Economic Growth + Budget**: Growing economies increase IT investment
4. **Digital Transformation + Technical**: Modernization reduces technical barriers

## FRICTION ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

### Scoring Framework
Each friction type scored 1-5:
- **1 - Minimal**: Little to no impact on entry/expansion
- **2 - Low**: Some impact but easily manageable
- **3 - Moderate**: Significant impact requiring specific strategies
- **4 - High**: Major barrier requiring substantial investment/time
- **5 - Severe**: Potentially prohibitive, may prevent entry

### Composite Friction Index (CFI)
**Formula**: CFI = Σ(Friction Score × Weight) / Σ(Weights)

**Standard Weights**:
- Regulatory: 20%
- Competitive: 20%
- Cultural: 15%
- Technical: 10%
- Economic: 10%
- Political: 10%
- Other categories: 15% combined

### Time Impact Estimation
**Friction Level → Time Delay**:
- Low (1-2): 0-3 months additional
- Moderate (3): 3-6 months additional
- High (4): 6-12 months additional
- Severe (5): 12+ months or indefinite

### Cost Impact Estimation
**Friction Level → Cost Multiplier**:
- Low (1-2): 1.0-1.25x base cost
- Moderate (3): 1.25-1.75x base cost
- High (4): 1.75-2.5x base cost
- Severe (5): 2.5x+ base cost
