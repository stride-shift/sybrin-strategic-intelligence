## CONCLUSION

The friction analysis reveals three distinct market clusters:

**Low Friction Cluster** (Rwanda, Kenya): 
- Immediate revenue potential with existing presence
- Combined $18M revenue opportunity in 12 months
- Focus executive attention here

**Moderate Friction Cluster** (Ghana, Tanzania, South Africa, Uganda):
- Selective opportunities worth pursuing
- Combined $24M revenue potential in 18 months
- Requires partnerships and patience

**High Friction Cluster** (Philippines, Zambia, Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia):
- Defer most except selective Philippines digital banks
- Combined opportunity large but timeline/risk excessive
- Not compatible with 18-month exit timeline

**Final Recommendation**: Focus 80% of resources on low-friction markets where Sybrin has presence or clear entry path. This approach maximizes revenue within the exit timeline while minimizing execution risk.
