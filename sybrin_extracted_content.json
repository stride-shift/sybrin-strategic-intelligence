          "Streamline your onboarding journey with the help of intelligent document capture and extraction. This feature leverages cutting-edge image processing, AI, and OCR technologies to ensure accurate data extraction from a wide range of identity documents, including ID cards and passports. By automating this process, we reduce manual errors and expedites verification times. Furthermore, users can conveniently capture and upload their documents remotely using mobile devices or web cameras, enhancing the overall user experience. This broad applicability makes Sybrin's solution suitable for a variety of onboarding scenarios.",
          "A Global and Comprehensive Approach",
          "Our module offers a powerful and user-friendly experience for capturing and processing identity documents. It can handle a vast range of IDs, including passports from all over the world (including ICAO passports), with exceptional accuracy thanks to its advanced OCR technology. Integrating the system into your existing workflow is a breeze with mobile SDKs for iOS and Android, as well as web APIs. To further streamline the process, the user experience is designed for minimal friction during document capture and upload. Security is a top priority, with support for MRZ and PDF417 barcodes, along with auto-cropping and AI-powered capture to guarantee high-quality and tamper-proof document acquisition. An additional benefit is the ability to function offline, ensuring uninterrupted service even without an internet connection."

The solution evaluates each transaction against pre-built topologies, which are carefully crafted to detect common fraud patterns like high-risk geographic locations, unusual transaction amounts, or suspicious transfer behaviours. In addition, users have the flexibility to customise detection behaviours through a user-friendly Configuration Manager. This manager allows fraud detection rules to be modified or extended without altering the underlying execution code, giving non-technical staff complete control over rule customisation. When a potentially fraudulent transaction is flagged, it is routed to the Compliance Workspace, a dedicated case management module designed to streamline the handling of fraud exceptions. This workspace helps investigators quickly assess, prioritise, and resolve cases, ensuring efficient management of fraud alerts.",
