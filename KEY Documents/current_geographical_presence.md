## Conclusion
Sybrin is genuinely a major player in African financial technology, particularly in East and Southern Africa where they have deep market penetration. Their claim of being in "20+ countries" is accurate but the depth of presence varies significantly. They are truly dominant in 4-5 countries, have meaningful presence in another 5-7, and limited/strategic presence in the remaining markets. Their expansion to Philippines represents their most significant non-African investment, while European and Middle Eastern presence remains limited to specific opportunities rather than comprehensive market coverage.
