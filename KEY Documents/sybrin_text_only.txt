Fraud Risk Management | FRM | Transaction Monitoring
Our Transaction Monitoring module is designed to detect potential fraud in real-time by applying preconfigured rule-based topologies through the open-source engine, Tazama. The system analyses transactions across multiple banking channels—including online, mobile, and in-branch—and supports various message formats, such as ISO 20022 and others, making it adaptable to a wide range of financial operations. The solution evaluates each transaction against pre-built topologies, which are carefully crafted to detect common fraud patterns like high-risk geographic locations, unusual transaction amounts, or suspicious transfer behaviours. In addition, users have the flexibility to customise detection behaviours through a user-friendly Configuration Manager. This manager allows fraud detection rules to be modified or extended without altering the underlying execution code, giving non-technical staff complete control over rule customisation. When a potentially fraudulent transaction is flagged, it is routed to the Compliance Workspace, a dedicated case management module designed to streamline the handling of fraud exceptions. This workspace helps investigators quickly assess, prioritise, and resolve cases, ensuring efficient management of fraud alerts.
