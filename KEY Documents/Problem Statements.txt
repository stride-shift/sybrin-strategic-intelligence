Consolidated Problem Statements for Strideshift
Research
1. Market Understanding & Decision Makers
 What is the true demand and willingness-to-pay for Sybrin’s solutions in the
Philippines and African markets — specifically Digital Onboarding, Payments
Processing (EFT, e-checks, instant payments), and Fraud & Risk Management
offerings?
 How do different market segments (commercial banks, rural banks, MFIs,
digital banks) value these solution types, and which are seen as must-have vs
optional?
 Who are the real decision makers in banks (often not the formal title holders),
and how do influence networks and cultural nuances affect buying decisions?
 How do trust and relationship dynamics (e.g., politeness in Philippines,
hierarchy in African banks) affect Sybrin’s ability to qualify and close
opportunities?

2. Competitive Landscape & Pricing
 How should Sybrin price Smart Teller and Payments upgrades, knowing
existing clients may be forced into tenders when required to re-buy?
 What are the optimum price points and preferred models (CapEx, subscription,
transaction-based) by customer type (rural, digital, MFI, commercial)?
 How can Sybrin overcome its proof of value vs pricing challenge, where
competitors undercut on price to buy market share?

3. Regulatory & Compliance
 What are the compliance requirements and costs (licenses, certifications,
permits) for entering and scaling in target markets, and could they be prohibitive
(e.g., $500k+)?
 How stable or fluid are regulatory environments in the Philippines and Africa,
and what changes are expected in the next 3–5 years?
 Can industry bodies or associations provide faster market access and
credibility?

4. Partnerships & Ecosystem Fit
 Why has Sybrin’s partner/reseller model underperformed in the Philippines,
and how should it be adapted?

 Which 2–3 strategic partners would be most critical to widen reach and
strengthen positioning?

5. Product Modernization & Differentiation
 How can Sybrin best consolidate fragmented teller systems (Web Teller,
VPC, Paperless, Uniteller) into a unified Smart Teller, ensuring feature parity,
migration ease, and scalability?
 How large is the re-monetization opportunity with existing 33 clients and 59
teller-related solutions generating only ~R10m revenue?
 Which emerging global teller trends (self-service, mobile tellers, universal
banker/advisory roles) are most important for Sybrin to align with?

6. Sales Execution & Outreach
 How can Sybrin build trust as a new entrant in the Philippines and overcome
limited on-the-ground presence?
 How to better understand decision-making timelines and influence networks
in key markets?
 Which channels, events, or media are most effective to position Sybrin as a
compliance-first thought leader, given limited LinkedIn usage in some
markets?

7. Geography-Specific Strategy
 South Africa: Is there any realistic payments market opportunity, or is it too
saturated and better to double down on Africa/Philippines?
 Africa: Where are the strongest use cases for e-checks (social grants, informal
lending, rentals, BNPL), and how should they be priced (per issue, per cashing,
per transfer)?
 Philippines: What compliance-first positioning strategies would differentiate
Sybrin most effectively against local/regional competitors?
