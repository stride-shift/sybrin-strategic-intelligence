Country-by-country rationale (what’s moving, why it matters, what it forces)
Zambia

Cheques decommissioned by 24 Jun 2026 (hard date). Bank of Zambia’s circular and public notice set a final stop for cheque acceptance, with staged milestones. This yanks the last paper fallback and forces full digital migration for retail, SME and corporate payables/receivables. Banks need instant-pay rails exposure, request-to-pay, mandate management, and fraud controls for account-to-account flows.

Data protection enforcement ramping (2025). The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has moved from paper to active enforcement this year; practical impact: DPIAs, processor contracts, breach playbooks, data subject rights tooling.

Central eKYC plan signalled by BoZ (strategy). BoZ’s 2024–27 plan contemplates a centralized eKYC platform—banks should prepare for API-first KYC orchestration and national ID lookups.

Botswana

Cheques already discontinued (from 1 Jan 2024). Residual migration work (corporate treasury, legacy mandates) still drives instant-pay adoption and R2P use cases.

New Data Protection Act (Act 18 of 2024) in force from 14 Jan 2025. Fresh obligations, broader scope, and penalties—banks need auditable consent/retention, vendor risk, and breach automation.

Malawi

Cheques end 31 Dec 2025 (hard date). Tight corporate migration window to account-to-account and QR.

Data Protection Act effective 2024; 2025 regs drafting. Expect registration and governance requirements—banks need privacy ops and records of processing.

Tanzania

Personal Data Protection Commission registration deadline (final extension) was 30 Apr 2025; enforcement ongoing. Late registrants face penalties; banks must evidence governance, DPO, and processor management.

Digital lenders guidance (Aug 2024). Tightens conduct and disclosure for digital credit—banks’ BNPL/digital-only products need policy and risk updates. 
Bot Tanzania

Kenya

FATF grey-listing (since Feb 2024) keeps AML improvements on a clock. Remaining action-plan items (beneficial ownership, supervision effectiveness, DNFBPs) mean banks must uplift monitoring, screening and EDD—and prove effectiveness.

Payments modernisation (FPS/ISO 20022). CBK has been migrating core rails and signalling a faster payments solution under the 2022–25 strategy—banks should budget for ISO 20022 and FPS connectors.

Data protection enforcement cadence is steady. ODPC determinations and enforcement mean sustained privacy ops. 
Data Protection Office

South Africa

FATF delisting on-site scheduled Oct 2025. Continued AML/CFT effectiveness push through 2026; banks must show improved case outcomes, sanctions screening, BO transparency.

POPIA regulation amendments (Apr/May 2025) now in force; regulator issuing fines. Tighter rights handling and reporting (breach portal) drive privacy tooling upgrades.

Open Finance policy path (FSCA). A multi-year roadmap into 2026 for data-sharing standards—banks should prepare for consented API data sharing and developer governance.

Ghana

Digital Credit Services Directive (Sep 2025) with licensing from 3 Nov 2025. Forces licensing, minimum capital, conduct rules; banks/affiliates must align digital lending stacks (KYC, scoring explainability, collections, dispute handling).

Ghana Card is the only acceptable ID for regulated financial transactions (effective since Jul 2022), with ongoing enforcement. This cements real-time biometric verification and eKYC orchestration.

Updated national AML risk assessment (2024). Reinforces risk-based controls—expect supervisory follow-through.

Instant Payment Network (IPN / InstaPay) participation mandated via CBE rules. Banks must connect and meet IPN operational/technical requirements—drives real-time payments integration, fraud tooling and ops.

Personal Data Protection Law 151/2020 in force; executive regulations pending but enforcement pathways hardening. Banks should not wait—implement GDPR-like privacy governance.

Zimbabwe

Data protection regulations (2024) operationalize registration/licensing of controllers/processors. Enforcement steps (registration, DPIAs, breach notices) require immediate privacy ops.

Uganda

Mass national ID renewal (2025–27) + active data protection enforcement. Banks will run periodic re-KYC, refresh consents, and harden privacy ops amid regulator actions and fines.

Mozambique

Draft Personal Data Protection Law—public consultation opened 3 Sep 2025. Early compliance prep (data mapping, contracts) reduces later scramble; tailwind rises when law passes.

Lesotho

National Payment Switch buildout (2024) and Payment Systems Bill (2024) under consideration. When mandated, banks will connect to national switch and upgrade clearing/instant use cases.

Philippines

BSP Circular (No. 1213, 2025): mandatory Fraud Management Systems (FMS) for BSFIs and ACH clearing switch operators, with a 1-year compliance window from effectivity. Requires automated, real-time monitoring, velocity/behavioural/geo rules, device fingerprinting, temporary holds, and anti-screen-scraping controls. This is a textbook near-term forcing function for FRM investments, customer-journey changes, and dispute ops.

FATF: Philippines removed from grey list (Feb 2025). AML pressure remains, but supervisory expectations stay high.

Regulatory tailwinds & deadlines matrix

How to read this: Each row is a country × regulation/initiative that creates demand in the next 6 quarters (Q4’25 → Q1’27). Tailwind strength (0–5) is my estimate of how much practical buying pressure this creates. Deadline proximity highlights the quarter of a hard/operational deadline where applicable. Coverage is retail vs wholesale relevance. Enforcement strength is a qualitative view of how binding the rule is right now. Implementation complexity is the relative lift for a typical mid-to-large bank. The Evidence column points to sources.

Why these matter for Sybrin-relevant buying motions

Instant payments (IPS) adoption & cheque shutdowns (Zambia, Malawi, Botswana already done, Namibia launching) force banks to procure: IPS gateways/connectors, alias/R2P, mandate management, and real-time FRM (behavioural/velocity/geo rules).

AML/FATF pressure (Kenya, South Africa) shifts spend to BO registries integration, case management outcomes, sanctions screening with richer ISO 20022 data, and risk-based monitoring.

Data protection enforcement waves (Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Uganda) create budget for privacy-by-design: consent/rights self-service, breach management, DPA registration workflows, and third-party risk.

BSP’s FMS mandate (Philippines) is the clearest “buy now” for enterprise fraud stacks across channels and at ACH level. Expect similar playbooks to be referenced by African regulators post-scam waves.
