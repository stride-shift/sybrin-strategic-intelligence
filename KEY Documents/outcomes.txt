REALISTIC MIXED MOTIVATIONS:

Yes, there's an 18-month exit timeline driving urgency, BUT:
- They genuinely want to solve the check decommissioning problem
- They actually care about their 99.9% uptime and customer trust
- The Philippines expansion could create real value beyond exit
- The upgrade program will benefit clients even after acquisition
- Financial inclusion through technology is a real commitment

BALANCED CHALLENGES THEY FACE:

- Balancing short-term exit needs with long-term sustainability
- Managing legacy technical debt while funding innovation
- Competing with both nimble startups and giant vendors
- Navigating complex emerging market dynamics
- Maintaining service quality while reducing costs
- Building new markets while protecting core revenue

LEGITIMATE STRATEGIC QUESTIONS:

- How to price fairly while remaining competitive?
- Which markets offer genuine win-win opportunities?
- How to leverage regulatory changes without being opportunistic?
- What partnerships create real mutual value?
- How to modernize without abandoning loyal legacy clients?
- Where can donor funding genuinely accelerate social impact?

THE BALANCED TRUTH:

Sybrin is a 30-year-old company at an inflection point, trying to transform from a legacy service provider to a modern SaaS platform while preparing for acquisition. They have genuine expertise in African payments, real relationships built on trust, and legitimate opportunities to enable financial inclusion. The exit timeline creates urgency, but many of their initiatives (upgrades, new products, market expansion) would be necessary regardless of ownership plans.

The research questions reflect both immediate commercial needs AND genuine desire to understand how to better serve emerging markets. They're trying to build something valuable enough to attract a buyer who will continue the mission, not just strip the assets.
