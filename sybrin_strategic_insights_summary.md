# Sybrin Strategic Insights Summary
## From Deep Dive Session - September 9, 2025

---

## 1. MARKET PENETRATION & GEOGRAPHIC STRATEGY

### Current Focus Markets
- **Africa**: 20 countries with at least one client, focusing on East Africa stronghold
- **Philippines**: Exclusive Southeast Asia focus (not broader SE Asia at this stage)
- **Excluded**: Nigeria, French-speaking Northwest Africa (except Ghana)

### Key Market Insights
- **Ghana**: Major opportunity - team visiting in October for a week
- **Malawi**: Despite declining economy, banks showing double-digit profit growth
- **Philippines Central Bank**: Just mandated fraud risk management for instant payment processors (major opportunity)
- **Southeast Asia**: Tembank's success suggests higher ROI than Africa ("half the effort for same returns")

### Market Entry Approach
- Get credibility in Philippines first, then expand to other SE Asian countries
- Target 4-5 African countries this year (down from unrealistic 14-country target)
- Follow regulatory changes as entry signals (e.g., decommissioning of checks)

## 2. COMPETITION & POSITIONING

### Competitive Landscape
- **Three-tier competition**:
  1. Local 5-person teams (compete on price, local relationships)
  2. Sybrin (middle market - competitive pricing, good support)
  3. Large OEMs/Gartner quadrant leaders (premium pricing, brand safety)

### Sybrin's Differentiators
- **Flexibility**: Willing to customize vs large players' rigid solutions
- **Support**: 99.9% uptime on payment processing for 100+ clients
- **Trust**: 30+ years track record, processing millions of transactions monthly
- **Pricing**: Competitive on software, but professional services costs becoming a barrier

### Challenges
- Legacy of bespoke solutions impacting cost structure
- Professional services fees too high after recent increases
- Difficulty competing in digital onboarding (cutthroat market)
- Brand recognition varies by product (payments strong in East Africa)

## 3. REGULATORY OPPORTUNITIES & COMPLIANCE

### Key Regulatory Trends
- **Check Decommissioning**: Botswana, South Africa complete; Zambia, Kenya, Malawi upcoming
- **Instant Payments Mandates**: Growing across Africa (IPSL in Kenya, PayShap in South Africa)
- **Cross-border Payments**: PAPSS (north) and TCCH (south) expanding
- **Regulatory Sandboxes**: Vietnam and others creating opportunities for innovation
- **Philippines**: Fraud risk management now mandatory for instant payments

### Strategic Response
- Building "eCheck" solution for electronic payment replacement
- Developing instant EFT processing module
- Creating connectors for domestic and cross-border payment schemes
- Need for "always-on" regulatory monitoring tool

## 4. PRODUCT & REVENUE STRATEGY

### Current Revenue Mix

### Strategic Shifts

- Focus on selling new software vs services
- Build recurring revenue base for better exit multiple
- Target completion of upgrades by September 2027

### Product Development Priorities

2. **In Pipeline**: Branch network solutions (potential 10M rand opportunity)
3. **Open Source**: Tazama (fraud risk) - Gates Foundation funded
