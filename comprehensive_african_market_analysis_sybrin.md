   - Ghana: West African foothold

### Final Strategic Guidance

The selection of 5 priority markets from 20+ possibilities reflects harsh commercial reality: limited resources, compressed timeline, and need for certain returns. The excluded markets represent calculated sacrifices—accepting concentrated risk for focused execution excellence.

Success requires discipline in maintaining exclusions despite opportunity temptations. The cost of pursuing marginal markets exceeds their contribution to exit value. Better to dominate 5 markets than struggle in 15.

This analysis provides the evidence-based rationale for every inclusion and exclusion decision, ensuring strategic choices withstand scrutiny from board, investors, and potential acquirers.
